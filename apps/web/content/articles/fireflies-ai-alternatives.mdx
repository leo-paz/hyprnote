Looking for a Fireflies AI alternative? You're not alone. Whether it's the surprise billing charges, privacy concerns about meeting bots, or just wanting something that actually works well with accents and multiple languages, plenty of people are ready to move on from Fireflies.

The AI meeting space has gotten way more competitive lately, which is great news if you're shopping around. There are now tools that prioritize privacy, offer transparent pricing, and deliver better accuracy across different languages and speaking styles.

Let's start by taking an honest look at what Fireflies actually delivers so you know exactly what you're looking to replace. Then we'll explore some solid alternatives that might be a better fit.

## Quick Fireflies AI Review

Fireflies is an AI meeting assistant that automatically joins your Zoom, Google Meet, or Teams calls through a bot. Once there, it records everything, transcribes the conversation in real-time, and shares AI-generated summaries with action items and key highlights.

<Image src="/api/images/blog/fireflies-ai-alternatives/fireflies-0.webp" alt="Fireflies AI 1-pager"/>

### The Good Stuff

**Setup is genuinely easy:** Connect your calendar, and the bot starts auto-joining your scheduled meetings without any extra work from you. For people managing tons of meetings, this automation is a significant timesaver.

**Transcription quality is decent:** In good conditions—clear audio, minimal background noise—you're looking at around 85-90% accuracy. That's solid enough to capture the gist of conversations and make them searchable later.

**AI summaries save time:** When they work well, the auto-generated summaries do capture key discussion points and action items. No more scrambling to remember what was decided three meetings ago.

**The search feature is actually useful:** Being able to type in keywords and instantly find where specific topics were discussed months ago is valuable, especially for sales teams tracking client conversations over time.

**Integrations work well:** If you're using a CRM, having meeting notes automatically sync there saves a ton of manual work. The Slack integration is particularly handy for team updates.

**Mobile app is convenient:** You can record and transcribe conversations on the go, which is useful for interviews or in-person meetings.

### Where Things Get Messy

**The billing situation is concerning:** Multiple users report being charged for plans they didn't knowingly sign up for. The trial cancellation process seems deliberately confusing, and many people only discover unexpected charges when reviewing their credit card statements. Some users even mention being unable to remove their payment information from the platform.

<Image src="/api/images/blog/fireflies-ai-alternatives/fireflies-1.webp" alt="Fireflies 1"/>

**Privacy issues are real:** By default, Fireflies shares meeting summaries with all attendees without asking first. You have to manually opt out of this behavior. For sensitive business discussions, that's problematic. Even more concerning, several users report the bot continuing to join meetings even after they've cancelled their accounts and deleted everything.

<Image src="/api/images/blog/fireflies-ai-alternatives/fireflies-2.webp" alt="Fireflies 2"/>

**Language support is limited:** Despite claims of supporting 100+ languages, Fireflies works best only in English. If your team is multilingual or you work with international clients, you'll likely run into accuracy problems.

<Image src="/api/images/blog/fireflies-ai-alternatives/fireflies-3.webp" alt="Fireflies 3"/>

**Hidden costs add up quickly:** Those fancy AI features like smart summaries and action items require additional "AI credits" that aren't included in your base subscription. What looks like a $29/month Business plan can easily become much more expensive once you factor in the credits needed for core functionality.

<Image src="/api/images/blog/fireflies-ai-alternatives/fireflies-4.webp" alt="Fireflies 4"/>

**Aggressive upselling tactics:** Users report extremely aggressive upselling tactics for non-pro accounts. The combination of storage restrictions and AI credits creates constant pressure to upgrade to higher-tier plans.

### The Bottom Line on Fireflies

Fireflies does what it promises for basic transcription and automation, especially if you're working in English and don't mind having a bot in your meetings. But between the billing issues, privacy concerns, and accuracy limitations, there are serious trade-offs to consider. You have other options available.
