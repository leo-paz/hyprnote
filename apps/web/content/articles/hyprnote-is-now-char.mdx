We're renaming Hyprnote to Char.

If you've been following us for a while, this might come as a surprise. But if you've been paying close attention, it's been a long time coming.

### How Hyprnote Got Its Name

The name Hyprnote originates from our initial project "sales note" — an attempt to build a notetaker for salespeople, born from my own experience. Yujong came up with _Hypernote_, but when I searched for the domain, nothing close to it was available with a `.com`. So I went with _Hyprnote_ to salvage the domain.

Honestly, I was never fully happy with the name. People constantly referred to us as "Hypernote." Every single chat, every meeting title — it was always "Acme {'<>'} Hypernote." It became a recurring frustration.

### The First Attempt

We actually tried to rebrand back in August 2025. The name I chose was _Arx_, Latin for fortress. Yujong didn't like it. And thanks to Harshika's SEO efforts, we had constant inflows of traffic. So we grew into our name and shelved the idea.

### Then Came the Letter

In December, we received a cease & desist letter from another company that had a similarly named product. After consulting our investors and legal counsel, we decided it was best to get a new name for our product.

### Finding the Right Name

We had multiple candidates: _Inklave_, _Artifact_, _Arx_ again. But we couldn't quite land on one. Either there was no acquirable domain, or it just didn't feel right.

### Why Char

Then the word _char_ struck my mind.

`char` is a keyword in the C programming language — reserved for defining a variable with a character type. In layman's terms, `char` is used to define a text.

Since Yujong and I are engineers at heart and our product is essentially a notepad, I thought it would be a brilliant name to tell our story.

Going deeper, `char` is a 1-byte data type. I liked the fundamental aspect of it — every user of Char is seeking insights from their interactions with others at the most fundamental level.

### What Changes

The product you know and love isn't going anywhere. Same team. Same mission. Same privacy-first, local-first AI notepad.

Just a new name that finally feels right.

Welcome to Char.
