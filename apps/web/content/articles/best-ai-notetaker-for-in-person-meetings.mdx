In-person meetings shouldn't mean going back to pen-and-paper note-taking. The right AI notetaker can capture every detail while you stay engaged in the conversation, but not all tools handle face-to-face meetings equally well.

We tested popular AI notetakers to see how they perform in real-world, in-person scenarios, and here are the tools that made the cut:

| Tool         | Best For                                                                       | Skip If                                                            |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Char     | Privacy-focused Mac users handling sensitive information                       | You need a mobile recording (iOS app coming soon)                  |
| Jamie AI     | International teams needing multilingual support with European data compliance | You need mobile recording or real-time transcription               |
| Fireflies AI | Teams needing comprehensive conversation analytics with mobile flexibility     | You prioritize data privacy or need real-time mobile transcription |
| MeetGeek     | Teams requiring comprehensive analytics and workflow automation                | You need real-time mobile transcription or have budget constraints |
| Otter AI     | Teams needing real-time transcription with strong collaboration features       | You handle sensitive information or have privacy concerns          |
| Granola AI   | Mac/iOS users who prefer manual note-taking with AI enhancement                | You need automatic speaker identification or Android support       |
| Read AI      | Teams seeking detailed meeting analytics and communication coaching            | You need Android support or extensive free usage                   |

## What Are the Must-Have Features for In-Person AI Notetakers?

To evaluate these tools fairly, we focused on five key features that make or break the in-person meeting experience. Each tool is assessed based on these criteria:

### 1. Mobile App Support

Can you record meetings directly from your phone or tablet? This matters because in-person meetings happen everywhere—coffee shops, client offices, conference rooms—and you can't always bring a laptop.

### 2. Offline/Local Recording

Does the tool work without internet connectivity? Many meeting locations have poor wifi, and some organizations restrict internet access during sensitive discussions.

### 3. Speaker Identification

How well does it distinguish between different voices? Unlike video calls where each person has a separate audio channel, in-person meetings require tools to identify speakers from a single audio source.

### 4. Real-time Transcription

Can you see live text during the meeting, or do you wait for processing afterward? This affects whether you can follow along in real-time or need to take backup notes.

### 5. Multi-language Support

How many languages can it handle accurately? International teams and diverse workplaces need tools that work across different languages and accents.

## What Are the Best AI Notetakers for In-person Meetings?

### 1. Char

[Char](/) is the only [local AI notetaker](/product/local-ai) available in the market. While competitors like Otter, Fireflies, and even ["bot-free" tools](/blog/bot-free-ai-meeting-assistants) like Jamie AI send your conversations to the cloud, Char processes everything locally on your Mac. It uses Whisper models for speech-to-text (ranging from Tiny to V3 Large Turbo) and their custom HyperLLM-V1 for summaries.

The interface feels like Apple Notes but with AI superpowers. Start a meeting, and it transcribes in real-time. When you hang up, you get structured summaries with decisions and action items automatically extracted.

The game-changer is complete data sovereignty. Your sensitive client conversations, therapy sessions, or legal discussions never leave your device unless you explicitly choose to connect to external APIs.
