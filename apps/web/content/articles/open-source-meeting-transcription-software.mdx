## Top Open-Source Meeting Transcription Software: Detailed Reviews

### 1. Char

[Char](/) is a local-first AI notepad that combines manual note-taking with real-time transcription.

The interface feels like Apple Notes, which is intentional. You open it and immediately start typing. No list of past meetings to navigate, no calendar integration to set up. Just a blank canvas that's ready when you are.

While you're writing, Char is listening to both your microphone and system audio. Once the meeting ends, it enhances your manual notes into actionable AI summaries based on your chosen template.

**Available as:** Native Mac app (desktop application, Windows coming soon)

#### Pricing

Completely free with no paid tiers, which may limit its use for organizations requiring dedicated assistance.

## Final Verdict: Which Open-Source Transcription Tool Should You Choose?

For most developers and privacy-conscious professionals, **Char** is the clear choice. It delivers local-first architecture without sacrificing usability. The custom HyperLLM-V1 model outperforms generic cloud APIs for meeting summarization, and the manual note integration gives you control over what the AI focuses on.

The code is open source (GPL-3.0), so you can verify exactly how your data is processed. Need enterprise deployment? Self-host it on your own infrastructure. Want to modify the summarization logic? Fork it and make it yours.

Most importantly, it just works. No complex setup, no security warnings to bypass, no dependencies.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### 1. Are open-source transcription tools really free?

Yes, all three are open source. Char and Amical are free for all users. Char has an optional Pro tier ($8/month) and Enterprise tier (custom pricing), but core transcription and summarization remain free forever.

Meetily is free for individual users under the MIT license. For organizations (2-100 users) and enterprises (100+ users), they offer custom paid plans, but pricing isn't publicly disclosed.

### 2. Do I need a powerful computer to run local transcription software?

You need a reasonably modern machine. For Char, an M-series Mac is ideal, though Intel Macs work with reduced performance. Meetily and Amical have similar requirements—at least 8GB RAM (16GB recommended) and a decent CPU. GPU acceleration helps but isn't required for basic functionality.

### 3. Can I use these tools offline?

Yes, that's the whole point. All three can transcribe meetings completely offline using local AI models. You only need internet if you choose to use cloud AI providers for enhanced summaries.

### 4. How accurate is the transcription?

With larger Whisper models, accuracy is typically 90-95% for clear English audio. Accuracy drops with background noise, heavy accents, or specialized terminology. Custom vocabulary features (where available) can improve accuracy for industry-specific terms.

### 5. What about HIPAA, GDPR, and compliance?

Because processing happens locally by default, these tools dramatically simplify compliance. Your data doesn't leave your device, which means you're not transmitting protected information to third-party processors. This makes HIPAA, GDPR, SOC 2, and other frameworks much easier to satisfy.

For organizations needing formal compliance documentation, both Char and Meetily offer enterprise plans with dedicated support.
