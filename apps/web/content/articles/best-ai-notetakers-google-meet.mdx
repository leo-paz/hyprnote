With millions of professionals using Google Meet daily, you'd expect Google to nail AI-powered meeting notes. They tried with "Take notes for me" - automatic meeting notes powered by Gemini AI, organized in Google Docs.

But it's only available to "a small group of users," requires expensive Workspace plans, works in just 8 languages, and often produces incomplete summaries. 

Even with access, Google's native solution lacks advanced features teams actually need: speaker identification, customizable templates, CRM integrations, and privacy controls for sensitive conversations.

That's why we tested dozens of specialized AI notetakers that work seamlessly with Google Meet while delivering the meeting intelligence that Google's native features can't match.

Here are our top picks: 

1. **Char:** Best for people and teams who seek control over data and AI stack.
2. **Fireflies AI:** Best for teams needing comprehensive conversation analytics and multilingual support.
3. **Sembly AI:** Best for teams needing automated deliverable generation and cross-meeting analytics
4. **tl;dv:** Best for sales teams needing video analysis, coaching insights, and CRM automation
5. **Tactiq:** Best for Chrome users wanting real-time transcription without installing separate apps
6. **Krisp:** Best for teams in noisy environments who need both audio enhancement and meeting notes
7. **Otter AI:** Best for users wanting familiar, mainstream AI transcription with team features

## What Are the Best AI Notetakers for Google Meet?

Let’s look at a detailed review of each of the shortlisted AI notetakers. 

### 1. Char: Best for Complete Control Over Your Data and AI Stack

Most transcription software force you into their cloud, their servers, their rules. You have no say about what happens to your data. This is why Char was built.

**[Char](http://char.com)** is an open-source AI note-taker that stores your data locally and gives you complete control over the AI stack. 

You decide if your audio, transcripts, or notes ever leave your device. And, you pick your preferred STT and LLM provider, which means you can go completely local if you want to. No forced stack. No lock-in. 

#### How It Works with Google Meet

Char doesn't join your Google Meet as a bot. Instead, it captures both your microphone input and your system’s audio. 

During meetings, Char transcribes your conversations in real-time, and when the meeting ends, it combines any notes you might have taken with your transcripts to create the perfect summary.

## Our Top Recommendation

You get AI-powered features without giving up ownership of your data. You get enterprise-grade functionality without vendor lock-in. You get ease of use without sacrificing flexibility.

This isn’t a bait and switch. You can try the tool out for free, and if you decide it's not for you, just export everything and walk away. That’s the deal!

## Frequently Asked Questions

### 1. Can Google Meet do AI notes?

Yes, but with significant limitations. Google's "Take notes for me" feature uses Gemini AI to generate meeting summaries in Google Docs. However, it's only available to a small group of users on expensive Workspace plans (Google One AI Premium or specific Business/Enterprise tiers), works in just 8 languages, and often produces incomplete summaries.

The bigger issue: you have no control over the AI processing. It runs in Google's cloud, uses their models, and follows their data handling practices. For organizations with compliance requirements or privacy concerns, that's a non-starter.

### 2. Does Google have a note-taking tool?

Google Docs serves as Google's general note-taking solution, and Google Keep handles quick notes and lists. For meetings specifically, Google offers "Take notes for me" powered by Gemini AI, but it's restricted to select Workspace plans and lacks features teams actually need.

### 3. How do I turn on AI transcription in Google Meet?

If you have access:

- Join a Google Meet
- Click the three dots menu (bottom right)
- Select "Take notes for me"
- Google's AI generates notes in a linked Google Doc during the meeting

### 4. Is there a botless AI notetaker?

Yes. Char and Tactiq both work without sending a bot into your meetings.

### 5. What is the most secure AI note taker for Google Meet?

For maximum security, run Char with fully local AI models (Ollama/LM Studio)—zero data leaves your device. For organizations that need cloud AI, bring your own approved API keys from providers your security team has already vetted.
