You're in a Zoom call when suddenly "Fred from Fireflies" joins the meeting. That little bot starts recording everything you say, transcribing your conversation, and promising to send you a nice summary afterward.

It's incredibly convenient. Until you start wondering: where do all those recordings actually go? And what exactly is Fireflies doing with them?

We decided to find out.

## What Is Fireflies AI?

<Image src="/api/images/blog/is-fireflies-ai-safe/fireflies-1.webp" alt="Fireflies" />

Fireflies AI is a cloud-based service that automatically joins your video calls as a bot participant. It records everything, transcribes the conversation, and uses AI to create summaries and insights. The bot integrates with popular platforms like Zoom, Google Meet, and Microsoft Teams.

Sounds helpful, but there's a catch - everything gets processed on Fireflies' servers, not your device. Your conversations become their data.

## What does Fireflies actually do with your data?

I went through their privacy policy and terms of service so you don't have to and here's what I found.

### 1. They're collecting everything about you

**Your meetings and more:**

- Complete audio recordings of every conversation
- Full transcripts and meeting summaries
- Your calendar data and scheduling details
- Information about everyone who attended

**Your personal details:**

- Name, company, email, home address, phone number
- Account passwords and login information
- Payment and billing data

**Your digital footprint:**

- Your exact location (yes, really)
- Your device IDs and MAC address
- What you search for and click on
- Your network information and browsing habits

**Access to your other accounts:**

When you connect Google Calendar or other services, Fireflies can access and store "any content that you have provided to and stored in your Third-Party Account" - including your contact lists.

### 2. The fine print that should worry you

**They're not responsible if their AI messes up:** Their terms explicitly say that while they use AI to process your conversations, "Fireflies is not liable for any loss or harm resulting from the user's use of AI." If something goes wrong with how they handle your data, you're on your own.

**Your data becomes theirs forever:** Fireflies keeps "all rights to aggregated and anonymous data derived from your use of the Service" with no expiration date. Even if they can't identify you personally, they own insights from your conversations permanently.

**They share your data widely:** Your information gets shared with their business partners, service providers, any company that might buy Fireflies in the future, or government authorities if they think it's necessary. Pretty much anyone they deem relevant to their business.

**You're legally responsible for everything:** Here's the kicker - their terms say "You are responsible for compliance with all recording laws." If you accidentally record someone without consent, that's your legal problem, not theirs.

This becomes especially problematic when users can't actually control when Fireflies records (more on that nightmare later) - you're still legally liable even if their bot shows up uninvited.

### 3. Their liability? Basically nothing

Even if Fireflies completely screws up and causes major damage, their maximum liability is capped at either what you paid them in the last six months or $100 - whichever is less.

Think about that. Your confidential business meeting gets leaked, costs you a major client, and Fireflies owes you... maybe $100.

## Why privacy concerns are users facing with Fireflies AI?

The privacy policy issues aren't just theoretical. Real users are reporting some pretty concerning problems:

### 1. It won't go away

Source: [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/sales/comments/1gw2xpk/how_to_uninvite_fireflies_from_my_meetings/)

Multiple people report that Fireflies keeps showing up in their meetings even after they:

- Deactivated their accounts
- Tried to uninstall it
- Asked their IT department for help
- Explicitly requested it to stop recording

One user described it perfectly: "Trying to shut it up/switch it off is like trying to remove a deer tick from your leg - messy and painful."

### 2. It shares transcripts with people who never signed up

Users report that Fireflies automatically sends meeting summaries to everyone on the calendar invite - including:

- People who never consented to being recorded
- External clients and partners
- Former employees who still have access to recurring meetings
- Anyone who happened to be invited but didn't even attend

### 3. It installs itself without permission

<Image src="/api/images/blog/is-fireflies-ai-safe/fireflies-4.webp" alt="Fireflies installs itself without permission" />

Several users report that just by joining a meeting where someone else used Fireflies, the software somehow installed itself on their computers and started recording their future meetings without their knowledge.

## Should I trust Fireflies with sensitive information?

It depends on what you're discussing.

**Definitely avoid Fireflies for:**

- Healthcare discussions with patient information
- Legal meetings requiring attorney-client privilege
- Financial services conversations with client data
- Any government or defense-related discussions
- International calls with people protected by GDPR
- Client consultations involving confidential business information

**Use extreme caution for:**

- Internal team meetings with sensitive company information
- Job interviews or HR discussions
- Sales calls with prospect data
- Executive or board-level conversations

**Use for:**

- Public webinars or presentations
- Non-confidential training sessions
- Casual team social meetings

But even then, remember that everyone in the meeting needs to consent to being recorded, and you're legally responsible if they don't.

## Final Verdict: Is Fireflies AI Safe?

Fireflies AI might seem convenient, but convenience comes at a steep privacy cost. Between their extensive data collection, broad sharing permissions, minimal liability, and documented issues with user control, it's just not worth the risk for most business conversations.

If you need AI-powered meeting assistance, choose a solution that keeps your data where it belongs, with you. Char proves you don't have to sacrifice privacy for functionality.

Your conversations are valuable. Don't give them away for free.
