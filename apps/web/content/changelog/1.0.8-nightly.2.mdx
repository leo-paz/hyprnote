## UI

- Transcript search now supports **replace**, **match case**, and **whole word** options, with keyboard shortcuts and improved navigation between matches
- Search now auto-scrolls to the active result and stays in sync between transcript and editor views
- Calendar UI has improved visual hierarchy (cleaner header spacing/typography and clearer weekend styling)
- Calendar onboarding now shows a proper loading state while calendars are being fetched, and onboarding button overflow spacing has been fixed
- Fixed metadata panel scrolling behavior in session headers for more consistent layout handling
