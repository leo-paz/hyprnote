## **Key Features That Matter in Meeting Minutes Software**

When evaluating meeting minutes software, focus on these five categories:

### **1. Transcription Accuracy**

Accuracy is non-negotiable if you're relying on automated transcription. Look for:

- 90%+ accuracy rates for clear audio
- Speaker identification capabilities
- Support for technical terminology and industry jargon
- Custom vocabulary training for specialized terms
- Multi-language support if needed

Most AI meeting minutes software achieves 90-95% accuracy in ideal conditions, but accuracy drops significantly with background noise, accents, or multiple speakers talking simultaneously.

### **2. Privacy & Security**

For sensitive conversations, privacy architecture matters more than compliance certifications:

- **Local-first processing** (Char) provides maximum privacy
- **End-to-end encryption** protects data in transit
- **Compliance certifications** (HIPAA, SOC 2, GDPR) verify security practices
- **Data retention policies** control how long recordings are stored
- **Access controls** manage who can view sensitive meetings

If your conversations involve confidential information, prioritize tools with local processing or strong encryption over convenient cloud-based options.

### **3. Integrations**

Meeting minutes software should connect with your existing workflow:

- **Calendar integration** (Google Calendar, Outlook) for automatic meeting detection
- **CRM systems** (Salesforce, HubSpot) for sales and customer data
- **Project management** (Asana, Jira, Monday.com) for task tracking
- **Communication platforms** (Slack, Teams) for sharing summaries
- **Document storage** (Google Drive, Dropbox) for archival

The best integrations are bidirectional—not just pushing data out, but pulling context in to make summaries more relevant.

### **4. Collaboration Features**

Teams need to work together on meeting documentation:

- **Real-time co-editing** for collaborative note-taking
- **Commenting and mentions** for feedback and questions
- **Shared agendas** built collaboratively before meetings
- **Approval workflows** for formal minutes requiring sign-off
- **Version control** to track changes and revert if needed

Remote teams particularly benefit from strong collaboration features that keep everyone aligned regardless of location.

### **5. Search & Retrieval**

Meeting minutes are only valuable if you can find information later:

- **Keyword search** across all transcripts and summaries
- **Semantic search** that understands context and intent
- **Filter by date, participant, or meeting type**
- **Topic-based organization** and automatic categorization
- **Quick access** to specific timestamps in recordings

The difference between a searchable meeting archive and 100 unsearchable documents is the difference between institutional knowledge and lost information.

## **Our Top Recommendation**

If you value both functionality and control, Char is the only tool on this list built for you.

You get AI-powered features without giving up ownership of your data. You get enterprise-grade functionality without vendor lock-in. You get ease of use without sacrificing flexibility.

This isn’t a bait and switch. You can try the tool out for free, and if you decide it's not for you, just export everything and walk away. That’s the deal!
