## Best AI Tools for Sales Meeting Notes: Detailed Reviews

### 1. Avoma

[Avoma](https://www.avoma.com) is an all-in-one AI meeting assistant and revenue intelligence platform built specifically for sales teams. It combines automated note-taking, conversation intelligence, deal risk alerts, and forecasting in one platform to help sales teams close more deals faster.

<Image src="/api/images/blog/sales-ai-note-takers/sales-1.webp" alt="review of Avoma for sales teams"/>

#### Who It's Best For

Growing sales teams (25-100 reps) who want an affordable all-in-one alternative to expensive tools like Gong or Chorus, and sales leaders who need pipeline visibility and coaching without breaking the budget.

#### Key Features

- **AI Meeting Assistant:** Automatic transcription in 75+ languages, custom AI note templates (MEDDIC, SPICED, SPIN), and AI-generated follow-up emails
- **Auto CRM Updates:** Automatically save notes and update custom CRM fields in Salesforce, HubSpot, Zoho, Pipedrive, and Copper
- **Conversation Intelligence Add-on:** AI call scoring, automated coaching recommendations, real-time answer assistant, talk pattern analysis, and custom keyword/topic tracking
- **Revenue Intelligence Add-on:** AI-powered deal risk alerts, automatic sales methodology tracking, pipeline inspection, forecasting reports, and AI win-loss analysis
- **Scheduler & Lead Router Add-on:** Group and round-robin scheduling, advanced lead routing rules, inbound form qualification, and SDR-to-AE handoff automation
- **"Ask Avoma" AI Copilot:** Get answers from individual meetings, across all conversations, or at the deal/account level
- **Smart Playlists:** Automatically curate call recordings based on rules for easy coaching and review
- **Integration ecosystem:** Native integrations with CRMs, dialers (RingCentral, Aircall, Kixie), Slack, MS Teams, Zapier, and more

#### Pros

- Built with sales workflows in mind, from MEDDIC scoring to deal risk alerts
- Replaces multiple point solutions (Otter + Gong + Chili Piper) with one integrated tool
- Free collaborators so view-only users (managers, marketing, CS) don't count toward your seat count
- 14-day unrestricted trial with all features including add-ons, no credit card required

#### Cons

- Add-on costs add up quickly, with Conversation Intelligence ($35/user/month) and Revenue Intelligence ($35/user/month) bringing total cost to ~$99-109/user/month
- Best for teams of 10+ as solo sales reps or very small teams might find better value in simpler alternatives
- Learning curve for advanced features due to the all-in-one nature
- Requires annual billing for Enterprise plan with a 10-seat minimum for SSO, HIPAA compliance, or advanced security features

#### Pricing

Base plans start at $29-39/user/month for unlimited transcription and CRM automation, making it accessible for small teams.

The real decision point is whether you need the add-ons: Conversation Intelligence ($35/user/month) for coaching and Revenue Intelligence ($35/user/month) for deal tracking can push costs to ~$100/user/month, but you only pay for seats that need these features.

For sales teams wanting Gong-level intelligence without the $100+/seat baseline, Avoma's flexibility delivers serious ROI.

### 2. Char

[Char](/) is a no-frills, privacy-first AI notepad for meetings that runs entirely on your device. Unlike cloud-based tools, it's designed for teams across any industry who need reliable meeting notes without sending a single byte of data off their machine.

<Image src="/api/images/blog/sales-ai-note-takers/sales-2.webp" alt="review of Char for sales teams"/>

#### Who It's Best For

Privacy-conscious professionals across all industries, from sales and consulting to healthcare and legal, who want unlimited, free AI meeting notes without cloud dependency or compliance concerns.

#### Key Features

- **Fully local processing:** All transcription and summarization happens on your device
- **Unlimited transcripts & summaries:** Completely free forever with no meeting limits
- **Bot-free meetings:** Works with all meeting platforms (Zoom, Teams, Meet, etc.) by listening to your computer's audio and microphone
- **Works offline:** Take notes, record audio, and transcribe meetings without internet connectivity
- **Flexible AI model options:** Go local, self-host, or connect to custom AI endpoints
- **Custom templates:** Create and save templates for different meeting types (limited on free, unlimited on Pro)
- **Chat with notes:** Query your meeting history conversationally (limited on free, unlimited on Pro)
- **Calendar integration:** Automatically detect and prepare for upcoming meetings
- **Mic/Speaker identification:** Distinguishes between your audio and system audio for one-on-one calls
- **Export options:** Markdown, PDF, and Rich text formats
- **Open-source:** Full transparency and customization options

#### Pros

- Truly unlimited transcripts and AI summaries completely free—no artificial caps or trial periods
- Works offline, perfect for field sales, remote locations, or when internet is unreliable
- No vendor lock-in with the option to connect your own AI models (OpenAI, Ollama, custom endpoints)
- Simple, distraction-free notepad interface focused purely on note-taking without sales-specific complexity
- Open-source with active development and rapid feature shipping based on user feedback

#### Cons

- macOS only (Sonoma 14.2 or later), requires M-series chip for best performance
- No advanced sales features like deal tracking, coaching metrics, or revenue intelligence
- Manual speaker tagging required for calls with multiple participants on one side
- Limited integrations compared to sales-specific tools (currently Obsidian and Attio)

#### Pricing

Char's free plan is genuinely what most tools claim theirs to be - unlimited transcripts and AI summaries with no strings attached, making it accessible to anyone who needs meeting notes without cloud concerns.

Pro at $8/month adds unlimited chat with your notes, unlimited custom templates, and workflow automation features, but the free plan alone handles core note-taking perfectly.

Enterprise offers custom pricing for teams needing SSO, consent management, and admin controls.

For sales teams, Char isn't a replacement for Avoma or Sybill's deal intelligence. It's the straightforward, privacy-first notetaker for professionals who want their conversations to stay theirs, whether you're in healthcare, consulting, sales, or any field where data sovereignty matters.

### 3. Fathom

[Fathom](https://www.fathom.ai) is an AI meeting assistant focused on simplicity and ease of use, offering unlimited transcription and basic summaries on its free plan. It provides sales-specific features like Deal View, CRM field sync, and AI scorecards for teams that need structured deal intelligence.

<Image src="/api/images/blog/sales-ai-note-takers/sales-3.webp" alt="review of Fathom for sales teams"/>

#### Who It's Best For

Individual sales reps or small teams (2-10 people) who want a user-friendly tool with generous free features, and sales leaders who need basic coaching metrics without enterprise complexity.

#### Key Features

- **AI meeting summaries:** Basic summaries on free plan; advanced summaries with custom frameworks on paid plans
- **Deal View:** Summarizes insights across multiple calls for a specific deal (Business plan only)
- **CRM integrations:** Auto-sync summaries and action items to HubSpot, Salesforce, Close, Pipedrive, and Copper
- **CRM field sync:** Update custom CRM fields automatically (Business plan only)
- **Ask Fathom:** Conversational AI to query meeting content and generate follow-up emails
- **AI scorecards & coaching metrics:** Grade calls against sales methodologies like MEDDIC or SPICED (Business plan only)
- **Clips, playlists, and search:** Highlight key moments and organize recordings
- **Keyword alerts:** Get notified via email or Slack when specific topics are mentioned
- **Integrations:** Slack, Asana, Zapier, and native CRM connections

#### Pros

- Simple, intuitive interface with minimal learning curve compared to complex platforms
- Works natively with Zoom, Google Meet, and Microsoft Teams without requiring a bot
- CRM sync available even on the free plan (limited to 3 users per domain)

#### Cons

- CRM field sync and Deal View only available on the most expensive Business plan ($28/user/month)
- Coaching metrics and AI scorecards also locked behind the Business plan, limiting its value for sales managers on lower tiers
- Team collaboration features require at least the Team plan ($18/user/month minimum 2 users)
- Less robust conversation intelligence compared to Avoma or Gong. No talk pattern analysis, sentiment tracking, or advanced topic intelligence

#### Pricing

Fathom's "generous" free plan is a bit of a mirage for active sales reps.

While you get unlimited transcription, the actually useful features (advanced summaries, AI action items, Ask Fathom) are capped at just 5 calls per month, which most salespeople blow through in a week.

For real utility, you'll need Premium ($20/month) for unlimited AI features as an individual, Team ($18/month per user, 2+ users) for collaboration, or Business ($28/month per user, 2+ users) if you want CRM field sync and Deal View.

### 4. tl;dv

[tl;dv](https://tldv.io) is an AI meeting assistant that emphasizes multilingual support (30+ languages) and multi-meeting intelligence. It provides AI-powered sales coaching, aggregated insights across calls, and deep CRM integrations for scaling teams.

<Image src="/api/images/blog/sales-ai-note-takers/sales-4.webp" alt="review of tl;dv for sales teams"/>

#### Who It's Best For

Sales teams that handle multilingual calls, sales managers who need coaching insights and multi-meeting trend analysis, and organizations wanting comprehensive intelligence across dozens of customer conversations.

- **Sales coaching platform:** AI-driven call analysis, playbook adherence tracking, objection handling insights, and performance metrics
- **AI speaker insights:** Track talk patterns across single or multiple meetings (Business plan)

- Enterprise-grade security (SOC 2, GDPR, ISO 27001) with option for privately hosted AI
- Unlimited uploads on Pro plan for analyzing pre-recorded calls
- Pro plan at $29/month offers unlimited AI notes, making it competitive for individual reps

#### Cons

- Advanced features like AI speaker insights (multi-meeting), sales playbook monitoring, and deeply customizable CRM integrations require the expensive Business plan ($98/month)
- A 3.4x increase from Pro to Business plan that's hard to justify for mid-sized teams
- No CRM field sync on Pro plan; requires Business tier for custom field mapping
- Free plan's 10 AI notes per month means active sales reps will need to upgrade immediately
- Sales coaching and playbook features are only fully unlocked on Business tier

#### Pricing

tl;dv's free plan is genuinely useful with 10 AI meeting notes per month (vs. Fathom's 5), unlimited recordings, and full transcription.

Pro at $29/month unlocks unlimited everything and is the sweet spot for individual reps or small teams.

However, sales managers needing coaching insights across multiple meetings or teams wanting custom CRM field mapping must jump to Business at $98/month, a steep increase that positions it closer to enterprise tools.

### 5. Sybill

[Sybill](https://www.sybill.ai/?) is an AI sales assistant purpose-built for account executives, functioning as a sales coordinator, personal assistant, and research analyst combined.

Unlike basic notetakers, Sybill learns from every call, email, Slack message, and CRM update to automate sales busywork across the entire deal lifecycle.

<Image src="/api/images/blog/sales-ai-note-takers/sales-5.webp" alt="review of Sybill for sales teams"/>

#### Who It's Best For

Account executives managing complex B2B deals who need deal-level intelligence and automation, not just meeting transcription, plus sales managers who want coaching insights without the enterprise price tag of Gong.

#### Key Features

- **Deal-centric AI:** Learns from calls, emails, Slack, and CRM to build complete deal context and answer questions across all touchpoints
- **Pre-meeting briefs:** Automated prep with company insights, deal history, attendee LinkedIn summaries, and talking points
- **Magic summaries:** AI-generated meeting summaries with outcomes, key takeaways, pain points, and next steps
- **100% CRM autofill:** Auto-extracts and fills MEDDPICC, BANT, and up to 10 custom CRM fields (Business plan) or unlimited fields (Enterprise)
- **AI follow-up emails:** Learns your writing style and drafts personalized emails 80% faster with customizable templates (Business plan)

- **AI tasks:** Captures, organizes, executes, and tracks tasks automatically across deals
- **Integrations:** Native CRM sync (Salesforce, HubSpot), Slack, email, calendar, Zapier, and works alongside existing call recorders like Gong

#### Pros

- Saves 14 hours/week on sales busywork according to customer data, with 80% faster follow-ups
- 100% CRM autofill rate eliminates manual data entry completely
- Can work alongside Gong/Chorus if you already have those tools
- 14-day free trial with full access to test deal intelligence features

#### Cons

- Business plan required ($99/month) to unlock the features that make Sybill worth it
- More expensive than basic notetakers like Fathom or tl;dv without offering coaching analytics or revenue intelligence found in Avoma
- CRM autofill limited to 10 fields on Business plan; unlimited requires Enterprise (custom pricing)
- Newer player in the market with less brand recognition than established tools

#### Pricing

Sybill's pricing reflects its positioning as a deal-focused AI assistant rather than a simple notetaker.

Essentials at $29/month offers basic transcription and summaries but strips out the deal intelligence features that make Sybill special.

The real value starts at Business ($99/month), which unlocks 100% CRM autofill (up to 10 fields), custom AI follow-up emails, Deal Workspace, and behavioral AI.

If you need unlimited CRM field mapping or advanced integrations, Enterprise requires custom pricing.

## So, Which Sales AI Notetaker Should You Actually Pick?

Spending hours updating CRM fields after every call? Sybill or Avoma will save you 10+ hours a week.

Handling deals across multiple languages? tl;dv is your answer.
