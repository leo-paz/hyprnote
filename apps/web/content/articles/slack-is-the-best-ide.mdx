I wear too many hats. Design, dogfooding, PM, support, marketing. I context-switch all day.

Async beats everything when you're jumping between roles this often.

## My stack

I use Devin, Claude Code, GitButler, Zed, and Warp. These are all good tools. But my center of gravity isn't any of them. It's Slack.

I have a channel called "product-with-devin." Bugs, feedback, and ideas get dumped there. Devin picks up tasks async. The whole team can see what's happening. Nothing gets lost in DMs or local files.

It feels like compiling thoughts into working code.

## How the workflow works

Something breaks. I drop a message in the channel. Devin picks it up and starts working. I move on to the next thing.

When it's done, I review the PR in GitButler. GitButler lets me look at multiple branches at once and manage stacked PRs. If the fix is good, I merge it. If something's missing, I spin up Claude Code and iterate.

For UI taste and micro-interactions, I use Zed. This is where I get hands-on with the details that matter.

## Why Slack works as an IDE

An IDE is supposed to be where you do your work. For most people, that's a code editor. For me, it's where context lives and where async work compounds.

Slack is where problems surface. Tasks get picked up there, and the whole team can see what's in flight and what's blocked.

Traditional IDEs assume you're sitting down to write code. That's not how I work anymore. I'm jumping between support, product decisions, and design tweaks. I need a system that lets me drop tasks and come back later.

Devin working in a Slack channel means I can dump a task and forget about it. When it's done, I get pinged. I review it when I have time.

## Sync vs async

Sync work requires everyone to be available at the same time. Async work lets people contribute when they have capacity.

When you're context-switching all day, sync work is a killer. You can't get into flow if you're constantly pulled into meetings or waiting for someone to respond.

Async work compounds. You drop a task, something picks it up, and when you come back it's done.

AI agents in Slack work better than a traditional IDE for the same reason email works better than phone calls for busy people. You don't have to be present for work to happen.

## What this looks like in practice

A user reports a bug. I drop it in the Devin channel with a screenshot and a description. Devin starts working on it. I go back to answering support emails.

Twenty minutes later, I get a ping. Devin finished the fix and opened a PR. I review it in GitButler. If it looks good, I merge. If not, I add comments and Devin iterates.

Meanwhile, I'm also working on a blog post in another channel. I dumped an outline earlier. An agent picked it up and wrote a first draft. I come back, edit it, and publish.

None of this required me to sit in one tool and focus for two hours. It all happened in pieces, async, across multiple channels.
