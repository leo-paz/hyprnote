If you're looking for free transcription tools to automatically transcribe your meetings, video, or audio files, we've researched the options for you.

Most "free" tools cap you at 30 minutes total, force upgrades after a trial period, or lock basic features behind paywalls.

This guide reviews genuinely free transcription software that works without constant payment prompts.

## How We Chose These Tools

We evaluated dozens of transcription tools using these criteria:

- **Automatic transcription only**: Manual transcription assistants help you type faster while listening to audio, but don't transcribe automatically. This guide focuses on software that actually transcribes for you.
- **Genuine free access**: We prioritized tools with permanent free plans, not trials disguised as "free" offerings.
- **Usable limitations**: Many "free" tools impose restrictions that make them unusable—10-minute one-time trials or 3-minute recording limits. We focused on tools where the free tier actually works for real-world use.
- **Transcription quality**: All selected tools use modern AI models (primarily OpenAI's Whisper) that deliver genuine accuracy.
- **Privacy and data handling**: We noted whether tools process locally or in the cloud, and whether your data gets used for AI training.
- **No hidden costs**: We clearly documented where free plans end and paid features begin.

Transcript.LOL is a cloud-based transcription platform powered by OpenAI's Whisper that converts audio and video files into text across 100+ languages.

The platform handles imports directly from Google Drive, Dropbox, YouTube, and Zoom, so you can transcribe content without downloading files first. You can also transcribe audio from WhatsApp or Telegram messages directly through integrations.

The daily allocation model provides 2 transcripts per day (up to 20 minutes each) rather than a monthly bucket that disappears quickly. For podcasters processing a few episodes weekly or professionals with regular but moderate transcription needs, this daily reset provides consistent access.

### 3. Riverside: Best for No-Signup Transcription

<Image src="/api/images/blog/free-transcription-software/transcription-5.webp" alt="riverside free transcription" />

While Riverside is primarily known as a podcast and video recording platform, their [standalone transcription tool](https://riverside.com/transcription) works as a simple web utility that converts any audio or video file to text.

The tool uses OpenAI's Whisper model and handles files up to 5GB across 100+ languages. Upload your file, wait a few minutes (a 50-minute file processes in roughly 5 minutes), and download your transcript as plain text or SRT format for video captions.

#### What's Free Forever

### 4. Otter.ai: Best for Meeting Bot Integration

<Image src="/api/images/blog/free-transcription-software/transcription-7.webp" alt="otter ai transcription review" />

Otter.ai is a meeting assistant similar to Char. It transcribes conversations, generates summaries, and helps you search through meeting history. The key difference is that Char processes everything locally on your device, while Otter sends all your audio to the cloud for processing.

The cloud approach enables Otter's signature feature: the meeting bot that automatically joins your Zoom, Microsoft Teams, and Google Meet calls based on your calendar, records everything, and shares notes with participants afterward.

#### What's Free Forever

The $30/month Business plan adds 6,000 minutes per user, 4-hour meeting support, unlimited file imports, concurrent meeting joining, usage analytics, and prioritized support.

Enterprise is relevant for organizations requiring SSO, HIPAA compliance, domain capture, custom CRM integrations, video replay features, or dedicated customer success management.

### 5. Notta: Best for Multi-Language Transcription

<Image src="/api/images/blog/free-transcription-software/transcription-9.webp" alt="Notta transcription review" />

[Notta](https://www.notta.ai/en) is a cloud-based transcription platform that handles 58 languages with claimed 98% accuracy.

Similar to Otter.ai, Notta automatically joins your Zoom, Google Meet, Microsoft Teams, and Webex meetings to transcribe conversations in real-time. The platform also accepts file uploads from YouTube, Google Drive, and Dropbox.

<Image src="/api/images/blog/free-transcription-software/transcription-10.webp" alt="notta pricing" />

The 3-minute recording limit makes the free plan nearly useless for actual meeting transcription. The $13.49/month Pro plan is necessary immediately, providing 1,800 minutes monthly, up to 5 hours per recording, 100 file uploads, 100 AI summaries, transcript translation, custom vocabulary, and exports in multiple formats (TXT, PDF, DOCX, SRT, XLSX).

The $27.99/month Business plan adds unlimited transcription, video recording for web meetings, CRM integrations with Salesforce and HubSpot, Zapier automation, usage analytics, and collaborative workspace features.

Enterprise becomes relevant for organizations requiring SAML SSO, audit logs, no AI training on your data, flexible payment options, priority support, and customized transcription quotas.

### 6. MacWhisper: Best for Simple Mac Transcription

<Image src="/api/images/blog/free-transcription-software/transcription-11.webp" alt="mac whisper review" />

[MacWhisper](https://goodsnooze.gumroad.com/l/macwhisper) is a Mac app that wraps OpenAI's Whisper technology in a simple drag-and-drop interface.

While tools like Char use Whisper as part of a complete meeting assistant, MacWhisper focuses purely on transcription. You drop in an audio file, it gives you text. The interface is minimal: drag your file, select a model size based on how much accuracy versus speed you want, and get your transcript with synced audio playback.

Performance depends heavily on your hardware. Apple Silicon Macs (M1/M2/M3) handle transcription smoothly, processing files at roughly 15x real-time speed. Older Intel Macs work but run significantly slower, especially with larger models that require more than 8GB of RAM.

#### What's Free Forever

- Unlimited transcriptions with no usage caps
- Three Whisper models: Tiny (fastest), Base (balanced), Small (more accurate)
- Plain markdown files, zero lock-in, your choice of AI stack
- Drag-and-drop interface for audio files
- Supports 100+ languages with automatic detection
- Audio playback synced to transcript
- Search and highlight keywords in transcripts
- Export as SRT, VTT, TXT, or copy to clipboard
- Supports MP3, WAV, M4A, MP4, MOV, OGG, OPUS formats
- Works completely offline once installed

#### When Will You Need to Pay?

<Image src="/api/images/blog/free-transcription-software/transcription-12.webp" alt="Mac whisper pricing" />

MacWhisper Pro ($29-35 one-time payment, no subscription) unlocks better accuracy with Medium, Large, Large-V2, or Large-V3 models, batch transcription to process multiple files simultaneously, speaker identification for multi-person conversations, system audio recording to transcribe Zoom or Teams meetings directly, and advanced exports including Word, PDF, and HTML formats.

## Our Top Recommendation for Free Transcription

If data privacy matters and you need truly unlimited transcription without hidden costs, Char stands out as the clear choice.

Unlike most transcription tools that lock you into their cloud, Char stores everything as plain markdown files and lets you choose your AI stack. Zero lock-in, complete control.

For teams handling sensitive conversations—patient consultations, legal discussions, financial planning, confidential business meetings—Char solves the fundamental problem that cloud-based tools can't: keeping your data private while delivering powerful transcription.
