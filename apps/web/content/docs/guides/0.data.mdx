## Base

There are two types of base directories: `global` and `vault`.

### Global

- Shared between `stable` and `nightly` builds (`staging` and `dev` builds use different folders).
- On macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/hyprnote/`
- On Linux: `~/.local/share/hyprnote/`

Contents:
- `db.sqlite` — local SQLite database (sessions, contacts, calendar events, tags)
- `models/stt/` — downloaded speech-to-text model files
- `store.json` — app state (onboarding status, pinned tabs, recently opened sessions, dismissed toasts, analytics preference, auth tokens)
- `hyprnote.json` — vault configuration (custom vault path if set)
- `search/` — full-text search index (Tantivy)

### Vault

- Customizable, defaults to be the same as `global` base for backward compatibility.
- You can change the vault location in Settings > General.

Contents:
- `sessions/` — one subdirectory per session, each containing:
  - `_meta.json` — session metadata (title, created date, participants)
  - `memo.md` — raw notes in Markdown with YAML frontmatter
  - `transcript.json` — transcription data (words, timestamps, speakers)
  - `*.md` — AI-generated enhanced notes (summaries, action items)
  - `attachments/` — file attachments
  - Audio `.wav` files — recorded audio
- `humans/` — contact and participant data
- `organizations/` — organization data
- `chats/` — chat conversation data
- `prompts/` — custom prompt templates
- `settings.json` — app settings

Here is how Char loads session content from disk — this shows exactly what files are read per session:

The transcript data structure stores word-level timestamps and speaker information:

The app state persisted in `store.json` is defined by this enum — nothing else is stored there:

### Logs

Application logs are stored in the system app log directory as rotating files (`app.log`, `app.log.1`, etc.).
