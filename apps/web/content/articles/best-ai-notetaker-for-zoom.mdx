## How We Chose These AI Notetakers

Our evaluation focused on tools that work seamlessly with Zoom while delivering reliable meeting intelligence. Here's what we prioritized:

- **Transcription accuracy** - How well does it handle multiple speakers, technical terms, and varying audio quality?
- **Summary quality** - Can it identify key decisions, action items, and important discussion points?
- **Integration capabilities** - Does it connect smoothly with workflow tools like Slack, CRMs, or project management platforms?
- **Privacy and security** - Where is data processed and stored? What compliance standards does it meet?
- **Ease of use** - How quickly can teams start using it without complex setup or training?
- **Pricing value** - Does it offer good functionality relative to cost, including free tier options?

> **Note:** Unlike some meeting platforms that offer built-in AI features, Zoom's native AI Companion requires a paid plan and has limited customization options.
>
> Third-party AI notetakers often provide more sophisticated features, better accuracy, and flexible deployment options that make them worth considering even for Zoom-centric organizations.

## What Are the Best AI Notetakers for Zoom?

### 1. Char

**Best for:** Privacy-conscious organizations and professionals seeking complete data control.

<Image src="/api/images/blog/best-ai-notetaker-for-zoom/zoom-1.webp" alt="Best ai notetaker for zoom" />

[Char](/) is the only truly [local AI notetaker](/product/local-ai) on this list. While other tools (even the [bot-free notetakers](/blog/bot-free-ai-meeting-assistants)) send your data to third-party cloud servers for processing, Char keeps everything on your device.

The interface feels like Apple Notes with AI superpowers. Start a meeting, and it transcribes in real-time. When you hang up, you get structured summaries with decisions and action items automatically extracted.

The AI can work completely hands-off, generating organized notes without any input from you. Or you can collaborate by jotting down key points, and the AI will intelligently expand your rough notes with context you might have missed while actively participating.

#### Key features

- Everything happens on your device (seriously, nothing leaves your Mac)
- Works offline - perfect for airplane meetings or sketchy WiFi
- Open source for security audits and customization
- Customizable templates for different meeting types (therapy, legal, interviews)
- Smart Consent Management Package for enterprise compliance
- AI Chat with MCP server connections for enhanced functionality
- Calendar integration with notification system
- Conversational search across all meeting history
- Flexible AI model options (local, self-host, or connect to custom AI endpoints)

#### Strengths

- Your conversations stay yours - zero privacy risks
- [Free forever AI notetaker](/blog/free-ai-notetakers) (not a trial that expires)
- No vendor lock-in since it's open source
- Works without internet - great for secure environments
- Future-proof as local AI models keep getting better
- Makes compliance simple by keeping data on-device

#### Considerations

- Mac only right now (Windows coming soon, though)
- No video recording by design for maximum privacy

#### Pricing

Free forever plan with unlimited AI summaries. Pro version costs $8 monthly for additional features like AI Chat, custom templates, annotations for transcripts, etc.

Char also offers an Enterprise plan for organizations that need an on-premise deployment, SSO integration, or smart consent management for compliance requirements. [Contact sales for a quote](/founders).

### 2. Zoom AI Companion

**Best for:** Teams already invested in Zoom's ecosystem who want built-in AI features.

<Image src="/api/images/blog/best-ai-notetaker-for-zoom/zoom-2.webp" alt="zoom ai companion review" />

[Zoom AI Companion](https://www.zoom.com/en/products/ai-assistant/?cms_guid=false&lang=en-US) is built directly into Zoom Workplace - working behind the scenes across Meetings, Team Chat, Phone, Email, and Whiteboard.

But compared to the specialized tools we've covered, it's pretty basic. You need a paid Zoom plan to access it; all features are disabled by default, and the core functionality is limited to meeting summaries, smart recording, in-meeting questions, and whiteboard assistance.

Unlike tools like Char that work offline and provide real-time transcription, Zoom AI Companion requires cloud processing and doesn't offer live transcription during meetings.

For any meaningful customization - like custom dictionaries, meeting templates, or third-party integrations - you'll pay an extra $12/user/month.

#### Key features

- Meeting summaries with next steps (but no real-time transcription)
- Smart recording with highlights and chapters
- In-meeting questions to catch up without interrupting
- AI-powered whiteboard content generation
- Custom templates and third-party integrations (paid add-on only)

#### Strengths

- Built directly into Zoom with no separate installations (disabled by default - admins must enable them)
- Meeting attendees get clear notifications when AI features are active
- Its federated AI approach uses multiple AI models for optimal results

#### Considerations

- Requires paid Zoom subscription - not available on free plans
- No real-time transcription or live collaboration like other tools
- Basic customization requires $12/user/month extra - more expensive than most standalone alternatives
- Not available for [HIPAA-compliant instances](https://zoom.oit.uci.edu/useful-zoom-features/ai-companion/)
- Limited accuracy and features compared to specialized AI notetakers

#### Pricing

Included with paid Zoom accounts, but the custom AI Companion add-on costs $12/user/month.

### 3. Fathom

**Best for:** Sales teams and customer-facing professionals who want instant summaries with CRM integration.

<Image src="/api/images/blog/best-ai-notetaker-for-zoom/zoom-3.webp" alt="Fathom for zoom" />

[Fathom](https://www.fathom.ai) joins your Zoom calls as a bot and focuses heavily on speed - you get meeting summaries within 30 seconds of hanging up. The main appeal is how it handles the post-meeting workflow, automatically pushing notes and action items into your CRM without manual work.

During calls, you can click buttons to highlight important moments or mark action items. After the meeting, everything gets organized into a summary that you can immediately forward to colleagues or sync with Salesforce.

#### Key features

- Direct integrations with major CRMs like Salesforce and HubSpot
- Works with 28 languages for international teams
- Custom summary templates you can modify for different meeting types
- Can create shareable video clips from longer recordings
- Search feature that works across your entire meeting history
- Takes screenshots automatically when people share screens

#### Strengths

- Actually free forever for core features (unlimited recordings and storage)
- CRM integrations work smoothly and save manual data entry
- Easy to create and share video highlights with teammates
- Handles multiple speakers and accents reasonably well

#### Considerations

- Bot appears in your meeting participant list (might feel awkward for sensitive calls)
- AI-powered features limited on free plan after first 5 summaries per month
- Works best with Zoom, other platforms feel secondary

#### Pricing

Free plan includes unlimited recordings and basic summaries. Premium costs $19/month for unlimited AI features. Team plans start at $29/month with collaboration tools.

### 4. Otter AI

**Best for:** Teams already comfortable with cloud-based tools who want established meeting automation.

<Image src="/api/images/blog/best-ai-notetaker-for-zoom/zoom-4.webp" alt="Otter ai for zoom" />

[Otter AI](https://otter.ai) is probably the most well-known AI meeting assistant out there - though not always for the right reasons, but we'll get to that later.

Credit where credit is due: Otter pioneered many features that are now standard in the industry.

It joins your Zoom, Google Meet, and Teams calls as a visible bot participant and delivers solid real-time transcription with speaker identification. You can assign action items to teammates directly in the transcript, and everyone gets access to searchable meeting notes immediately after calls end.

However, Otter has developed a reputation for privacy issues that have made headlines.

Users have reported that the bot sometimes joins meetings without proper consent and spams all participants with meeting notes. There's currently an [ongoing class-action lawsuit](/blog/is-otter-ai-safe) regarding these privacy practices.

#### Key features

- Real-time transcription with live team collaboration features
- AI Chat for querying meeting history and generating follow-ups
- Mobile app that syncs seamlessly across devices
- Custom vocabulary that learns technical terms and company language
- Integration with CRMs and productivity tools

#### Strengths

- Excellent real-time collaboration with commenting and highlighting
- Strong speaker identification that improves with usage
- Reliable platform with consistent performance and updates
- Mobile app handles both virtual and [in-person meetings](/blog/best-ai-notetaker-for-in-person-meetings) effectively

#### Considerations

- Free plan limited to 300 monthly minutes (gets consumed quickly)
- Language support restricted to English, Spanish, and French only
- Bot presence visible in meetings can feel intrusive for sensitive calls
- Serious privacy considerations

#### Pricing

Free plan with 300 monthly minutes. Paid plans start at $16.99/user/month.

[tl;dv](https://tldv.io) is a video-focused meeting assistant that records your Zoom, Google Meet, and Teams meetings and creates shareable video clips from longer recordings.

What makes tl;dv different is its emphasis on post-meeting workflow automation. It can automatically update your CRM with call details, draft follow-up emails based on conversation content, and generate aggregated insights across multiple meetings.

#### Key features

- Automatic CRM updates and follow-up email drafting

<Image src="/api/images/blog/best-ai-notetaker-for-zoom/zoom-6.webp" alt="fireflies ai for zoom" />

[Fireflies.ai](https://fireflies.ai) works pretty similarly to Otter AI, in that its AI assistant "Fred" automatically joins your meetings and creates detailed transcripts.

When meetings end, it generates structured summaries with clear action items, decisions, and next steps automatically extracted.

**Best for:** Customer-facing teams who need to extract revenue insights from their conversations.

<Image src="/api/images/blog/best-ai-notetaker-for-zoom/zoom-8.webp" alt="avoma for zoom" />

What makes [Avoma](https://www.avoma.com) different is its focus on sales coaching and deal intelligence. The platform provides AI-powered scorecards for call performance, tracks talk patterns and engagement, and offers deal risk analysis.

**Best for:** Teams that live in Chrome and want real-time transcription without installing separate apps.

<Image src="/api/images/blog/best-ai-notetaker-for-zoom/zoom-9.webp" alt="tactiq for zoom" />

Unlike the standalone apps we've covered so far, [Tactiq](https://tactiq.io) works as a Chrome extension. This completely different approach means no separate software to install - it just lives in your browser and captures audio directly from Google Meet, Zoom, and Teams tabs.

The integration ecosystem is where Tactiq really shines. It pushes meeting insights to Slack, HubSpot, Jira, basically everywhere you actually work.

You can turn frequent AI prompts into one-click actions, so you don't have to start from scratch every time you need follow-up tasks.

<Image src="/api/images/blog/best-ai-notetaker-for-zoom/zoom-10.webp" alt="krisp ai for zoom" />

[Krisp](https://krisp.ai) is the multitasker of bot-free tools - it cancels background noise AND takes meeting notes. The platform removes background noises, voices, and echoes from both sides of calls while transcribing meetings in real-time across all communication apps.
