If bots make you nervous, privacy is on your mind, and you want more than simple note-taking and unlimited free recordings, you should look beyond Fathom AI.

## Quick Fathom AI Review

I tested Fathom AI for weeks. It does what it says on the tin—a meeting bot that transcribes your Zoom, Meet, or Teams calls and generates summaries in about 30 seconds after the call ends. The CRM sync works well for sales teams.

But the limitations become apparent quickly:

- **They're training AI on your meetings.** Unless you manually dig into settings and opt out, your data trains their models. Most users don't know this is happening.
- **You can end up in their database without signing up.** If someone uses Fathom in a meeting with you, your voice, email, and conversation content gets collected—and they might market to you.
- **The desktop app is just a recording widget.** There's nowhere to write down your thoughts during the meeting.
- **No real-time transcription.** You're flying blind during calls, and it doesn't work without internet. Dead WiFi means a dead tool.
- **The bot is always visible.** For sensitive client calls or therapy sessions, having "Fathom Notetaker" in your participant list changes the dynamic.
- **The unlimited free plan is actually quite limited.** You get unlimited transcription and recordings, but AI summaries cap out at five per month.

If any of that bothers you, here are the top Fathom AI alternatives.

## 5 Best Fathom Alternatives: Detailed Reviews

### 1. Char: For When Control Actually Matters

Full disclosure—I'm the co-founder of [Char](/). I built it because every other tool locked you into their cloud, their models, their rules. No way to switch, no way out.

Char is an open-source AI notepad for meetings. Everything is stored as plain markdown files on your device—not in proprietary databases. You choose which AI processes your data: managed cloud, bring your own API keys, or run local models.

You get a real notepad interface. Open Char and you see a notepad. Type notes during meetings, and the AI enhances them with context from the transcript. Real-time transcription appears while people are talking, not after.

**Best For:** Engineers, developers, and technical founders. Privacy-conscious professionals in healthcare, legal, and finance. People who already use tools like Obsidian or local-first workflows. Anyone whose company has banned cloud tools like Otter or Granola.

#### Key Features

- Real-time transcription during meetings (unlike Fathom's post-meeting approach)
- Instant summary generation within seconds
- Notepad-like interface for active note-taking
- Customizable templates for any meeting type (therapy, legal, sales, interviews)
- AI Chat for follow-up questions with source verification
- Conversational search across all meeting history
- Multiple export formats (Markdown, PDF, Rich Text)
- Works with any meeting platform and in-person meetings
- Smart Consent Management Package for compliance
- Flexible deployment options (local, self-host, or custom AI endpoints)

#### Strengths vs Fathom

- Zero lock-in—plain markdown files, open source, portable format
- Your choice of AI stack—managed cloud, bring your own keys, or run local
- True file ownership—works with Obsidian, Notion, VS Code, anything
- Works completely offline—airplane meetings or sketchy WiFi work fine
- No bot in your meetings—zero meeting disruption
- Open source code for security audits and customization

#### Limitations

- macOS only currently
- Basic speaker identification—distinguishes mic vs system audio, but can't automatically separate multiple Zoom participants
- Fewer integrations—no direct CRM sync like Fathom's Salesforce/HubSpot automation

#### Pricing

Free forever for local transcription, BYOK, and all core features. No usage caps, no artificial limits. Managed cloud service is $8/month for the easiest setup. Enterprise pricing covers on-prem deployment, smart consent management, and SSO—[contact sales for a quote](/founders).

### 2. Avoma: If You're Serious About Sales

[Avoma](https://www.avoma.com) is a complete revenue intelligence platform that actually helps your sales team improve.

It joins meetings as a bot, but unlike Fathom's basic summaries, it automatically structures notes around what matters for sales—pain points, budget, decision criteria, next steps. If you're using MEDDIC or SPICED frameworks, it populates those fields automatically.

**Best For:** Sales teams needing coaching analytics, deal intelligence, and automated CRM updates. Works best for teams of 10+ reps who need scalable coaching.

<Image src="/api/images/blog/fathom-ai-alternatives/fathom-2.webp" alt="Avoma vs fathom ai" />

#### Key Features

- Automated CRM field updates (pain points, budget, buying intent, next steps)
- Two-way CRM sync with Salesforce and HubSpot—update anywhere, reflects everywhere
- Deal risk analysis flagging when engagement drops or stakeholders go silent
- Sales methodology tracking (MEDDIC, SPICED, NEAT, BANT, Sandler)
- Competitive intelligence tracking mentions across all conversations
- AI-powered call scoring based on custom criteria
- Talk-listen ratio, question quality, objection handling analysis
- Filler word tracking and monologue alerts
- Topic tracking showing what your team spends time discussing
- Curated playlists of best calls for training new reps

#### Strengths vs Fathom

- Automated CRM field updates—goes way beyond Fathom's basic note sync
- Call scoring without manager time—every call graded automatically (Fathom requires manual review)
- Deal risk analysis—flags problems before they kill deals (Fathom doesn't track this)
- Comprehensive coaching analytics—performance trends, not just transcripts
- Complete meeting lifecycle—scheduling through follow-up (Fathom is recording only)

#### Limitations

- Expensive—realistically $54-109/user/month once you add features you actually need (vs Fathom's $20)
- Complex setup—expect 1-2 weeks getting everything configured (Fathom works in 5 minutes)
- Steep learning curve—not "install and forget" software
- Bot-based recording—still joins as visible participant like Fathom
- English-focused—works in 30+ languages but optimized for English

#### Pricing

Starts at $19/user/month base, but you'll need add-ons ($35-70/user/month) for conversation intelligence and coaching features. Realistic total: $54-109/user/month for full functionality. Free 14-day trial available.

### 3. Read AI: The Everything-Everywhere Tool

[Read AI](https://www.read.ai) takes a completely different approach than Fathom. Instead of just doing meetings, it connects meetings, emails, and messages into one searchable knowledge base.

Read's Search Copilot works across everything. Ask "What did the engineering team say about the API redesign?" and it pulls answers from meetings, Slack threads, and email chains. This is genuinely useful when you're piecing together decisions made across multiple channels.

**Best For:** Teams who need unified search across all communications, not just meetings. Works well for product teams, executives, and anyone coordinating across multiple platforms.

<Image src="/api/images/blog/fathom-ai-alternatives/fathom-3.webp" alt="Read ai vs fathom ai" />

#### Key Features

- Search Copilot querying meetings, emails, Slack, and CRM data in one place
- Pre-meeting summaries showing what happened last time and open action items
- Multi-meeting insights tracking discussions over time
- Custom tags for organizing meetings by type, team, or project

- Automated meeting reports with summaries, action items, key questions
- Engagement metrics showing who's checked out or dominating conversations
- 20+ language transcription support
- Recording playback with synchronized transcripts

#### Strengths vs Fathom

- Unified search—one query across all communication channels (Fathom only searches meetings)
- Pre-meeting context—shows relevant past discussions automatically (Fathom doesn't do this)
- Email and message summarization—beyond just meetings (Fathom is meeting-only)
- Engagement analytics—track who's participating (Fathom's metrics are more basic)
- Send bot to meetings you skip—still get notes without attending

#### Limitations

- Stingy free plan—only 5 meetings/month vs Fathom's unlimited recordings
- Bot joins uninvited sometimes—users report this happening despite settings
- No offline mode—requires internet like Fathom
- Limited free features—5-meeting cap feels restrictive for regular users
- No in-person meeting support—meeting platforms only, like Fathom

#### Pricing

Free plan offers 5 meetings per month with basic features. Paid plans start at $19.75/user/month.

### 4. Fireflies: When You Need Conversation Analytics

[Fireflies.ai](https://fireflies.ai) has been around longer than most competitors, and it shows in the analytics depth.

The conversation analytics go way deeper than Fathom. Speaker talk time, sentiment analysis, topic tracking, even monitoring for specific keywords across all calls. If you're tracking how often competitors get mentioned or what objections keep coming up, Fireflies surfaces those patterns automatically.

**Best For:** Teams needing conversation analytics, sales teams tracking objections, product teams monitoring feature requests, or anyone managing high meeting volume.

#### Limitations

### 5. Sembly AI: The Enterprise Compliance Specialist

[Sembly AI](https://www.sembly.ai) built its reputation on one thing: meeting the compliance requirements that make procurement teams happy. SOC 2 Type II, HIPAA, GDPR—Sembly checks boxes that most meeting assistants ignore.

Fathom gives you basic summaries and expects you to handle compliance yourself. Sembly was designed from the ground up for regulated industries. Healthcare, finance, legal—teams that can't afford to mess around with data security.

**Best For:** Enterprise organizations needing strict compliance, regulated industries (healthcare, finance, legal), teams building secure knowledge bases, or anyone where HIPAA/SOC 2 certification isn't optional.

<Image src="/api/images/blog/fathom-ai-alternatives/fathom-5.webp" alt="Sembly ai vs fathom ai" />

#### Pricing

Free plan offers 60 minutes of transcription per month. Paid plans start at $15/user/month.

## Which Is the Best Fathom AI Alternative?

**If control and zero lock-in matter, use Char.** Plain markdown files, your choice of AI stack, and complete ownership. Engineers, developers, privacy-conscious professionals in healthcare and legal, or anyone whose company has banned cloud tools—Char gives you ownership at the foundational level. You also get real-time transcription and offline support that Fathom can't match.

**If you're running a sales team and budget allows, go with Avoma.** The automated CRM updates and call scoring actually improve team performance. The coaching analytics are worth the price if you're serious about revenue. Budget realistically—you'll need $70-110/user/month for features you actually want.

**If you need unified search across all communications, Read AI is worth exploring.** The ability to query meetings, emails, and Slack in one place is genuinely useful for product teams and executives tracking decisions across channels. Negotiate the Pro pricing—don't accept the first quote.

**If you want conversation analytics on a budget, Fireflies works.** The unlimited free transcription beats Fathom's 5-summary cap, and the pattern recognition across meetings is deeper. Watch the storage limits and disable auto-sharing to all participants.

**If compliance certifications are required, Sembly is your answer.** SOC 2, HIPAA, GDPR out of the box. Regulated industries can't use tools without these certifications, and Sembly was built for that purpose.
