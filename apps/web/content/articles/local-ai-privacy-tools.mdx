## Intro

In the past decade, we've watched a new generation of software companies win not by collecting more data, but by collecting none. [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/) built a search engine without profiling users. [Brave](https://brave.com/) gave people a browser that blocked trackers by default. [Proton](https://proton.me) delivered email and cloud storage that not even they could read.

Each of these tools rejected the tradeoffs that Big Tech made years ago—usability traded for privacy, performance traded for control. They proved that privacy isn't just a niche preference. It's a product category.

Now, AI is testing that principle again.

## Privacy, Revisited

The AI boom has delivered stunning capabilities but also renewed surveillance. A meeting you record with an AI notetaker gets sent to the cloud. A contract you upload for AI review gets logged on someone else's server. Even just asking ChatGPT a question reveals more about you than most search queries ever did.

The current generation of AI tools is fundamentally cloud-first. To use them is to surrender control over what you share, where it goes, and who might see it later.

Where are the privacy-first tools in AI?

Just as DuckDuckGo and Brave offered new choices for search and browsing, and Proton reimagined communications, we now need tools that bring the same principles into this new era.

## Why Local AI Works

When it comes to AI, there's only one model that offers true privacy assurance: local AI.

Two things make this work:

### 1. Physical assurance

When AI runs on your device, no data ever needs to leave it. Cloud-based models promise "we won't look." Local AI guarantees "we can't look." This shifts privacy from policy to physics.

### 2. No training risk

Even if cloud tools promise not to store data, many reserve the right to learn from your inputs. Your private content can help train models that power other people's experiences. With local AI, there's no risk of data reuse because there's no training loop. What happens on your device stays on your device.

This is a trust decision. And it's becoming foundational to privacy in the AI age.

## A Familiar Pattern

We've seen this before.

When DuckDuckGo launched, a search engine that didn't track you felt almost paradoxical. But people wanted it, and the company grew as users chose control over convenience.

Brave did the same for browsing. Their browser shipped with ad-blocking, fingerprinting prevention, and default tracker protection. People already understood why this mattered.

Proton entered a crowded market of productivity apps but stood out by offering zero-access encryption. Users weren't just buying features. They were buying values.

These companies didn't invent new use cases. They reimagined familiar ones—search, browsing, email—and recentered them around privacy.

AI is the next interface ripe for that shift.

## Where Char Comes In

At [Char](/), we're building an open-source AI notepad for meetings that gives you complete control. Everything is stored as plain markdown files. You choose your AI stack—managed cloud, bring your own keys, or run local models. Zero lock-in, zero compromises.

We open-sourced our core app so anyone can audit it. We support offline mode by default, and for teams that need collaboration, we offer self-hosted options that never touch external servers. You can even bring your own models.

Our users include salespeople, engineers, lawyers, doctors, and founders—people who deal with sensitive conversations every day.

Char isn't just about note-taking. It lets AI enhance your work without owning it.

## The Privacy Stack Is Evolving

Privacy-first software now means building an ecosystem of tools that work locally, transparently, and under your control.

The early stack looked like:

- **Search** → DuckDuckGo
- **Browsing** → Brave
- **Communication** → Proton

With the rise of AI, a new layer is forming:

- **Cognition** → Char (and others like it)

This stack isn't defined by features. It's defined by where your data lives and who controls it. Users are increasingly choosing tools where they can answer "me" to both questions.

## Final Thoughts

Cloud-first AI is colliding with growing demand for control and ownership. As more workflows get automated and augmented by AI, the need for zero-lock-in, transparent, user-controlled solutions will only grow.

Local AI is the inevitable future—not just for performance, but for principle. Just as early privacy pioneers reshaped the web, we're helping reshape AI.

If you've ever used DuckDuckGo, Brave, or Proton and wished there was something similar for your meetings, we built Char for you.
