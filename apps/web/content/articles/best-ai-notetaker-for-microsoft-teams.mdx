## Native AI Notetaker Solutions for Microsoft Teams

There's no free native way to get AI-powered meeting notes, summaries, or intelligent transcription analysis from Microsoft.

Teams with Microsoft 365 Business/Enterprise get meeting transcription with speaker identification, but still NO AI summaries or intelligent note-taking.

Now let's see what native options Microsoft actually offers for AI meeting notes:

### 1. Microsoft 365 Copilot: The Premium AI Assistant

<Image src="/api/images/blog/best-ai-notetaker-for-microsoft-teams/teams-2.webp" alt="Microsoft 365 Copilot" />

[Microsoft 365 Copilot](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/use-copilot-in-microsoft-teams-meetings-0bf9dd3c-96f7-44e2-8bb8-790bedf066b1) is an AI assistant that works across Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, and Teams, powered by large language models. For Teams specifically, it transforms how you handle meeting preparation, participation, and follow-up.

**Important Note:** Microsoft 365 Copilot is different from the [free Copilot](https://copilot.microsoft.com) available in browsers and Bing.

Also, Copilot does not record meetings itself. You need to provide it with a meeting transcription to generate a summary and AI notes.

#### Microsoft 365 Copilot's Teams Integration Features

- Cross-app integration across Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, and Teams
- Real-time meeting intelligence with context understanding and topic organization
- Intelligent summarization including decisions, action items, and participant insights
- Post-meeting Q&A capability for specific questions about meeting content
- Facilitator feature for virtual meeting moderation and mid-meeting recaps
- Cross-reference capabilities connecting meetings with past discussions and documents

#### Pros

- Native integration eliminates compatibility issues
- Enterprise-grade security with Microsoft's compliance framework
- Cross-platform consistency across all Microsoft 365 apps
- Contextual intelligence beyond basic transcription
- No meeting bots required - cleaner meeting experience
- Continuous AI improvements from Microsoft's ongoing development

#### Cons

- Premium pricing at $30/user/month (as of 2025)
- Requires existing Microsoft 365 subscription
- Limited customization compared to specialized tools
- Some advanced features still in preview
- Performance can vary with audio quality and meeting complexity

#### Pricing

Microsoft 365 Copilot costs $30 per user per month, in addition to your existing Microsoft 365 Business Premium or Enterprise subscription. This positions it as a premium solution primarily suited for organizations heavily invested in the Microsoft ecosystem.

### 2. Teams Premium: Enhanced Meeting Features

<Image src="/api/images/blog/best-ai-notetaker-for-microsoft-teams/teams-3.webp" alt="Teams Premium" />

[Teams Premium](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-teams/premium) serves as Microsoft's mid-tier solution, bridging the gap between basic Teams and full Copilot functionality.

#### Key Features

- Intelligent meeting recap with key talking points and decisions
- Live translation for 40+ languages with real-time transcription
- Advanced meeting options including custom backgrounds and security controls
- Basic AI insights for action item extraction and organization

#### Pros

- More affordable than the full Copilot solution
- Immediate availability without preview limitations
- Good transcription accuracy in optimal conditions
- International team support with live translation
- Enhanced security features for sensitive meetings

#### Cons

- Limited AI capabilities compared to Copilot
- Still requires an additional subscription beyond basic Teams
- Less sophisticated summarization
- No cross-app integration
- Basic action item detection

#### Pricing

Teams Premium is priced at $10 per user per month, making it a more accessible option for organizations wanting enhanced AI features without the full Copilot investment.

## Best Third-Party AI Notetakers for Microsoft Teams

While Microsoft's native solutions work well for many organizations, third-party tools often provide specialized features, better privacy controls, or more competitive pricing.

Here's my analysis of the leading alternatives:

### 1. Char: The Privacy-First AI Notepad

Char is a [local-first AI notepad](/product/local-ai) designed specifically for compliance-sensitive organizations and privacy-conscious professionals.

Unlike cloud-based competitors, Char processes everything locally using on-device AI models, ensuring that not a single byte of your meeting data ever leaves your machine.

**Full Disclosure:** I'm the co-founder of Char, so I'll try to be as objective as possible in this review.

**How It Works with Microsoft Teams:** Char doesn't join your Teams meetings as a bot. Instead, it captures both your microphone input and your computer's system audio, so it naturally hears both sides of the conversation.

It transcribes your call in real-time, and once the meeting ends, you get structured summaries with decisions and action items automatically extracted.

No bots to invite, no meeting links to manage, no wondering if the service is down.

<Image src="/api/images/blog/best-ai-notetaker-for-microsoft-teams/teams-4.webp" alt="best ai notetaker for microsoft teams" />

#### Key Features

- Multiple deployment options; keep everything on your device for maximum privacy, deploy on your own servers for compliance, or use cloud setup for convenience
- Complete local processing option with a custom HyperLLM-V1 model optimized for summarization quality
- Real-time transcription using Whisper models ranging from lightweight to highly accurate versions
- Universal platform compatibility works with Teams, Zoom, Google Meet, and in-person meetings without any setup
- Bot-free operation means no disruption to your meeting flow or participant experience
- Vendor flexibility connects to any AI provider, including OpenAI, Mistral, or custom endpoints
- Smart consent management for Enterprises with multiple options from simple pop-ups to voice recognition that listens for verbal consent

#### Pros

- Deployment flexibility from maximum privacy (edge-only) to instant setup (full SaaS) with hybrid options
- No vendor lock-in since you can choose your preferred AI models and providers
- Free core functionality with transcription and basic summarization at no cost
- An open source codebase allows for inspection, customization, and community contributions
- Can work completely offline, making it perfect for air-gapped environments
- Makes compliance simple by keeping data on-device

#### Cons

- macOS only currently (Windows or Linux versions coming soon!)
- No video recording by design for maximum privacy
- Limited integrations compared to established players with extensive third-party ecosystems
- Basic speaker identification currently distinguishes only between microphone and system audio

#### Pricing

<Image src="/api/images/blog/best-ai-notetaker-for-microsoft-teams/teams-5.webp" alt="Char pricing" />

Char is a [free AI notetaker](/blog/free-ai-notetakers), which means you'll likely never need to pay for Char's core features.

Consider upgrading to Pro ($8/month) only when you want unlimited everything and advanced features like custom templates.

Enterprise becomes relevant when your organization needs an on-premises deployment, SSO integration, or consent management for compliance requirements. [Contact sales for a quote](/founders).

### 2. Otter AI: The Established Cloud-Based Solution

[Otter AI](https://otter.ai) is one of the most well-known names in AI transcription, offering cloud-based meeting intelligence that works across Microsoft Teams, Zoom, and Google Meet.

**How It Works with Microsoft Teams:** Otter joins your Teams meetings as a participant/bot. It records the audio, generates real-time transcripts, and creates meeting summaries automatically.

Setup involves account creation + calendar connection + bot invitation setup (moderate).

The bot can be invited manually or set to auto-join meetings based on your calendar integration.

However, recent privacy concerns surrounding Otter indicate that it sometimes joins meetings without proper consent and spams all participants with meeting notes.

### 3. Tactiq: The Browser Extension Approach

[Tactiq](https://tactiq.io) is one of the bot-free AI meeting assistants that works as a Chrome extension to transcribe Microsoft Teams, Google Meet, and Zoom meetings.

**How It Works with Microsoft Teams:** Install the Chrome extension and join your Teams meeting in the browser.

A small transcription widget appears showing live captions with speaker identification.

After the meeting, you can use one-click AI actions to generate summaries, action items, or ask specific questions about the conversation.

You can invite it manually to specific meetings or set it to auto-join based on your calendar integration.

The bot records, transcribes, and processes the entire conversation, then automatically sends meeting summaries to designated Teams channels.

It's important to note that the setup process can be a bit complicated. It involves creating a Fireflies account, verifying email, connecting your Microsoft calendar, configuring auto-join preferences, setting up Teams channel integrations for receiving summaries, and potentially getting IT approval for the bot to join company meetings.
