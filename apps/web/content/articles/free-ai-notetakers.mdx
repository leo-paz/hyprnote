## Why Char May Be Your Best Choice

These 9 tools offer genuine value without upfront costs—unlimited transcription from Fireflies, solid team features from Otter, multilingual support from Notta, and reliable recording from tl;dv.

But there's a catch in every "free" offering: your privacy and data. Fireflies analyzes your conversation patterns. Fathom's bot joins sensitive client calls. Tactiq processes confidential discussions on remote servers. You're paying with access to your most private conversations.

Char operates entirely on your device. No cloud processing, no data collection, no privacy trade-offs. It delivers unlimited AI summaries, real-time transcription, and meeting intelligence on your hardware.

When "free" means no cost and no compromise, that's when you've found the right choice.

[Download Char for macOS](/download) to experience meeting intelligence that costs nothing and compromises nothing (Windows and Linux versions coming soon!).
