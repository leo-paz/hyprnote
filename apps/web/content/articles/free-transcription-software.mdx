If you're looking for free transcription tools to automatically transcribe your meetings, video, or audio files, we have done the research for you.

## How We Chose These Tools

We evaluated dozens of transcription tools and selected these six based on what actually matters for free users:

- **Automatic transcription only**: Manual transcription assistants, which just help you type faster while listening to audio, were excluded. This guide focuses on software that actually transcribes for you.
- **Genuine free access**: We prioritized tools with permanent free plans, not trials disguised as "free" offerings. Each tool on this list provides ongoing access to core transcription features without requiring payment.
- **Usable limitations**: Many "free" tools impose restrictions that make them unusable, like 10-minute one-time trials or 3-minute recording limits. We focused on tools where the free tier actually works for real-world use cases.
- **Transcription quality**: All selected tools use modern AI models (primarily OpenAI's Whisper or similar) that deliver genuine accuracy, not outdated speech recognition that requires extensive manual correction.
- **Privacy and data handling**: We noted whether tools process locally or in the cloud, and whether your data gets used for AI training.
- **No hidden costs**: We clearly documented where free plans end and paid features begin, so you know exactly what you're getting.

## Popular Transcription Tools We Didn't Include (and Why)

### 4. Trint

[Trint](https://trint.com) provides a 7-day free trial (up to 3 files) with no ongoing free tier. Plans start at $80/month.

### 2. Transcript.LOL: Best for Multi-source Imports

<Image src="/api/images/blog/free-transcription-software/transcription-3.webp" alt="is transcript lol free" />

Transcript.LOL is a cloud-based transcription platform powered by OpenAI's Whisper that converts audio and video files into text across 100+ languages.

The platform handles imports directly from Google Drive, Dropbox, YouTube, and Zoom, so you can transcribe content without downloading files first.

You can also transcribe audio from WhatsApp or Telegram messages directly through integrations, making it convenient for processing voice notes on the go.

Also, the platform runs on a daily allocation model: 2 transcripts per day (up to 20 minutes each) rather than a monthly bucket that disappears quickly.

For podcasters processing a few episodes weekly, content creators handling daily voice memos, or professionals with regular but moderate transcription needs, this daily reset provides consistent access without the pressure to batch everything at once.

#### What's Free Forever

- 2 transcripts daily (up to 20 minutes each)
- 99.8% accuracy with OpenAI Whisper
- Speaker detection and recognition
- Import from Google Drive, Dropbox, YouTube, Zoom, URLs
- Basic editing tools (find & replace, speaker assignment, highlighting)
- Export as TXT, DOCX, PDF, SRT, VTT
- Chrome extension, WhatsApp, and Telegram integrations
- Low priority processing (slower turnaround)

#### When Will You Need to Pay?

<Image src="/api/images/blog/free-transcription-software/transcription-4.webp" alt="transcript lol pricing" />

You'll need the $20/month Unlimited plan when you exceed 2 daily transcripts, need files longer than 20 minutes, want AI summaries and custom prompts, require chatbot features for querying transcripts, or need high-priority faster processing.

Upgrade to $40/month Team plan when you need shared workspaces for collaboration, multiple user accounts under one subscription, and team access management features.

### 3. Riverside: Best for No-Signup Transcription

<Image src="/api/images/blog/free-transcription-software/transcription-5.webp" alt="riverside free transcription" />

While Riverside is primarily known as a podcast and video recording platform, their [standalone transcription tool](https://riverside.com/transcription) works as a simple web utility that converts any audio or video file to text.

The tool uses OpenAI's Whisper model and handles files up to 5GB across 100+ languages. Upload your file, wait a few minutes (a 50-minute file processes in roughly 5 minutes), and download your transcript as plain text or SRT format for video captions.

It's straightforward, no bells and whistles, but it works reliably for basic transcription needs.

#### What's Free Forever

- Unlimited transcriptions with no signup required
- 99% accuracy using OpenAI Whisper
- Supports 100+ languages and accents
- Files up to 5GB (approximately 50+ minutes)
- Real-time processing (transcribes while you wait)
- Download as TXT or SRT (caption format)
- Timestamps included in transcript
- Works with MP3, WAV, MP4, MOV formats

#### When Will You Need to Pay?

<Image src="/api/images/blog/free-transcription-software/transcription-6.webp" alt="riverside pricing" />

You'll need Riverside's paid platform ($19/month Standard or $29/month Pro) when you want speaker detection and labeling, in-tool transcript editing with audio playback sync, AI-powered Magic Clips for social media, automated show notes generation, text-based video editing, or professional recording features with 4K video and separate audio tracks.

The free transcription tool works fine for basic text conversion, but serious content creators will quickly outgrow its limitations and upgrade for the editing workflow integration.

### 4. Otter.ai: Best for Meeting Bot Integration

<Image src="/api/images/blog/free-transcription-software/transcription-7.webp" alt="otter ai transcription review" />

Otter.ai is a meeting assistant similar to Char. It transcribes conversations, generates summaries, and helps you search through meeting history.

The fundamental difference is architecture: while Char processes everything locally on your device, Otter sends all your audio to the cloud for processing.

That cloud-based approach enables Otter's signature feature: the meeting bot. "OtterPilot" automatically joins your Zoom, Microsoft Teams, and Google Meet calls based on your calendar, records everything, and shares notes with participants afterward.

For teams already comfortable with cloud services and living in scheduled meetings, this automation feels natural once you accept having a visible bot participant in your calls.

#### What's Free Forever

- 300 transcription minutes per month (resets monthly)
- 30-minute max per conversation
- Live transcription in English, Spanish, or French
- Automatic meeting bot joins Zoom, Teams, Google Meet
- Speaker identification and AI summaries
- 20 AI Chat queries per month (3 per conversation)
- iOS and Android apps
- Search by keywords and basic playback
- Export as MP3 or TXT only (no PDF, DOCX, or SRT on free)
- 25 most recent conversations stored (older ones deleted)

#### When Will You Need to Pay?

<Image src="/api/images/blog/free-transcription-software/transcription-8.webp" alt="otter ai pricing" />

You'll need the $16.99/month Pro plan when you exceed 300 minutes, need 90-minute conversations instead of 30, want 1,200 monthly minutes, require PDF/DOCX/SRT exports, need unlimited conversation history, or want advanced search and custom vocabulary features.

Upgrade to $30/month Business when your team needs 6,000 minutes per user, 4-hour meeting support, unlimited file imports, the ability to join 3 concurrent meetings, usage analytics, and prioritized support.

Enterprise becomes relevant for organizations requiring SSO, HIPAA compliance, domain capture, custom CRM integrations, video replay features, or dedicated customer success management.

### 5. Notta: Best for Multi-Language Transcription

<Image src="/api/images/blog/free-transcription-software/transcription-9.webp" alt="Notta transcription review" />

[Notta](https://www.notta.ai/en) is a cloud-based transcription platform that handles 58 languages with claimed 98% accuracy.

Similar to Otter.ai, Notta automatically joins your Zoom, Google Meet, Microsoft Teams, and Webex meetings to transcribe conversations in real-time.

- 120 transcription minutes per month (resets monthly)

- 10 AI summaries per month

#### When Will You Need to Pay?

<Image src="/api/images/blog/free-transcription-software/transcription-10.webp" alt="notta pricing" />

You'll need the $13.49/month Pro plan immediately for actual meeting transcription since the 3-minute recording limit makes the free plan nearly useless.

Pro gives you 1,800 minutes monthly, up to 5 hours per recording, 100 file uploads, 100 AI summaries, transcript translation, custom vocabulary, and exports in multiple formats (TXT, PDF, DOCX, SRT, XLSX).

Upgrade to $27.99/month Business when your team needs unlimited transcription, video recording for web meetings, CRM integrations with Salesforce and HubSpot, Zapier automation, usage analytics, and collaborative workspace features.

Enterprise becomes relevant for organizations requiring SAML SSO, audit logs, no AI training on your data, flexible payment options, priority support, and customized transcription quotas beyond standard plans.

### 6. MacWhisper: Best for Simple Mac Transcription

<Image src="/api/images/blog/free-transcription-software/transcription-11.webp" alt="mac whisper review" />

[MacWhisper](https://goodsnooze.gumroad.com/l/macwhisper) is a Mac app that takes OpenAI's Whisper technology and wraps it in a simple drag-and-drop interface.

While tools like Char use Whisper as part of a complete meeting assistant, MacWhisper focuses purely on transcription. You drop in an audio file, it gives you text.

The interface is minimal: drag your file, select a model size based on how much accuracy versus speed you want, and get your transcript with synced audio playback.

Performance depends heavily on your hardware. Apple Silicon Macs (M1/M2/M3) handle transcription smoothly, processing files at roughly 15x real-time speed. Older Intel Macs work but run significantly slower, especially with larger models that require more than 8GB of RAM to function well.

#### What's Free Forever

- Unlimited transcriptions with no usage caps
- Three Whisper models: Tiny (fastest), Base (balanced), Small (more accurate)
- 100% local processing (audio never leaves your Mac)
- Drag-and-drop interface for audio files
- Supports 100+ languages with automatic detection
- Audio playback synced to transcript
- Search and highlight keywords in transcripts
- Export as SRT, VTT, TXT, or copy to clipboard
- Supports MP3, WAV, M4A, MP4, MOV, OGG, OPUS formats
- Works completely offline once installed

#### When Will You Need to Pay?

<Image src="/api/images/blog/free-transcription-software/transcription-12.webp" alt="Mac whisper pricing" />

You'll need MacWhisper Pro ($29-35 one-time payment, no subscription) when you want better accuracy with Medium, Large, Large-V2, or Large-V3 models, batch transcription to process multiple files simultaneously, speaker identification for multi-person conversations, system audio recording to transcribe Zoom or Teams meetings directly, or advanced exports including Word, PDF, and HTML formats.

## Our Top Recommendation for Free Transcription

If data privacy matters and you need truly unlimited transcription without hidden costs, Char stands out as the clear choice.

Unlike most transcription tools that send your audio to cloud servers, Char processes everything on your device using local AI models; not a single byte leaves your machine.

For teams handling sensitive conversations, whether patient consultations, legal discussions, financial planning, or confidential business meetings, Char solves the fundamental problem that cloud-based tools can't: keeping your data completely private while delivering powerful AI-powered transcription.
