## How We Selected the Best Granola AI Alternatives

To compile this list of Granola AI alternatives, we analyzed hundreds of user reviews across G2, Capterra, and Reddit, conducted hands-on testing of leading AI notetakers, and identified the most frequently cited limitations that drive teams to seek alternatives.

### 2. Platform Compatibility

Some users report issues with Granola's limited platform support (currently Mac-only) and the absence of mobile apps that restrict on-the-go usage.

### 3. Integration Limitations

Granola doesn't integrate with popular workplace tools like Asana, ClickUp, or Zapier, which limits its usefulness for teams wanting to share notes automatically. We focused on tools with robust third-party integrations beyond basic calendar sync.

### 4. Missing Advanced Features

Granola doesn't record video or allow access to audio recordings, making it less suitable for hiring interviews or user research.

### 5. Value & Pricing Concerns

With Granola's $18/month individual plan and limited free tier, we looked for alternatives offering better features-to-price ratios or more generous free plans for teams and individuals.
