Transcribing Zoom calls manually is time-consuming and error-prone. Fortunately, you can automate this process using either Zoom's built-in transcription feature or more powerful third-party AI tools.

This article presents both methods and helps you choose the one that's right for you.

## Method 1: Transcribing Zoom Calls Using Zoom's Built-in Transcription

Let's start with what Zoom offers natively. Zoom provides audio transcription that automatically transcribes the audio of meetings or webinars that you record to the cloud.

### What do you need to get started?

Before diving in, you'll need:

- **Zoom account type:** Pro, Business, Education, or Enterprise account (basic free plan doesn't include transcription)
- **Cloud recording enabled:** Transcription only works with cloud recordings
- **Admin permissions:** Depending on your organization's setup

Beyond transcription, if you're looking to learn more about Zoom's meeting summaries feature, we have a detailed [Zoom AI Companion Review](/blog/zoom-ai-companion-review) you might want to check out.

## Method 2: Using Third-Party Tools to Transcribe Zoom Calls

While there are many excellent options available (check out our comprehensive guide on the [best AI notetakers for Zoom](/blog/best-ai-notetaker-for-zoom) for a detailed comparison), we highly recommend Char—not just as a transcription tool, but as a complete AI notetaking solution.

### What is Char?

Char is a privacy-first [local AI notepad for meetings](/product/local-ai) that goes far beyond simple transcription. Unlike cloud-based alternatives, Char runs entirely on your device, ensuring that not a single byte of your data leaves your computer. This makes it perfect for:

- **Privacy-sensitive conversations:** Healthcare professionals, lawyers, counselors, and anyone handling confidential information
- **Compliance-heavy industries:** Organizations meeting HIPAA, GDPR, SOX, or CCPA requirements
- **Reliable offline functionality:** Works perfectly without internet connectivity
- **Universal compatibility:** Works with all meeting platforms without requiring bots

On top of it all, Char not only transcribes your meeting in real-time, but also generates actionable summaries automatically, without any bots joining your call. Let's see how!

### How Does Char Transcribe Zoom Meetings Automatically?

Here's a step-by-step process to use Char for real-time Zoom transcription and note-taking.

### Why choose Char over Zoom's native transcription?

The differences become clear when you compare what you get with each approach:

#### 1. Accuracy and Reliability

*Source*

While Zoom users report spending hours editing 45-60 minute transcripts due to poor accuracy and formatting issues, Char's advanced AI models provide superior transcription quality with minimal manual cleanup required.

#### 2. Privacy and Control

Zoom processes your conversations in the cloud, raising compliance concerns for sensitive industries. Char keeps everything on your device; not a single byte of your data leaves your computer.

#### 3. Intelligence vs. Basic Text

Zoom gives you raw transcript files that require manual organization. Char delivers structured notes with automatic extraction of key points, decisions, and action items.

#### 4. Long-term Value

Zoom transcripts sit in isolation, difficult to search across meetings or connect insights over time. Char builds a searchable knowledge base where you can find patterns, track decisions, and understand the evolution of projects.

#### 5. Interactive Intelligence

Zoom gives you static transcript files. Char lets you have conversations with your meeting notes through AI chat—ask "What are my action items?" or "What exactly did Sarah say about the budget?" and get instant answers without scrolling through pages of text.

#### 6. Flexibility

Zoom locks you into their ecosystem and processing limitations. Char works with any meeting platform, offers custom templates, and gives you complete deployment flexibility, from local-only processing, on-premises deployment to private cloud options.

And did we mention? Char offers its core features, including unlimited AI summaries and transcription free forever. Why not give it a try?

## Frequently Asked Questions

### 1. How to get Zoom transcript without recording?

Unfortunately, Zoom's native transcription feature only works with cloud recordings. You cannot generate transcripts from Zoom without recording the meeting first.

However, third-party tools like Char can capture and transcribe your Zoom audio in real-time without requiring you to record the meeting to Zoom's cloud servers.

### 2. Where are Zoom transcripts stored?

Zoom transcripts are stored in Zoom's cloud servers alongside your recorded meetings. You can access them through the Zoom web portal under "Recordings."

The transcripts are saved in VTT format, which you can download and convert to other formats like Word documents or PDFs. This cloud storage raises privacy concerns for sensitive meetings.

### 3. What's the best alternative to Zoom's transcription?

For privacy-conscious users, Char offers the best alternative with its local-first approach; no data ever leaves your device.

For those comfortable with cloud processing, other popular alternatives include Otter AI, Fathom, and Tactiq. Check out our comprehensive guide on the [best AI notetakers for Zoom](/blog/best-ai-notetaker-for-zoom) for a detailed comparison

### 4. How accurate is Zoom's native transcription?

Zoom's transcription accuracy has significant issues.

[Users report](https://community.zoom.com/t5/Zoom-Meetings/Transcription-Highly-Inaccurate/m-p/130271) that the transcription is highly inaccurate with problems including incorrect speaker identification, common words needing editing even with clear speech, and frequent formatting errors.

### 5. Can I transcribe Zoom calls offline?

Zoom's native transcription requires an internet connection and cloud processing, so it cannot work offline.

However, Char can transcribe Zoom calls completely offline using local AI models, making it perfect for situations with unreliable internet.

### 6. Do I need a paid Zoom account for transcription?

Yes, Zoom's transcription feature requires a Pro, Business, Education, or Enterprise account. The basic free Zoom plan does not include transcription capabilities.

In contrast, Char offers unlimited transcription and AI summaries free forever, regardless of your Zoom account type.
