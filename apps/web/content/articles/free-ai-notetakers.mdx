## Top 9 Truly Free AI Notetakers for Meetings

### 1. Char: Best for Local Processing and Data Control

This local processing approach dramatically reduces your compliance surface area by eliminating third-party vendor dependencies and keeping sensitive data on-device.

Not a single byte leaves your machine, making it ideal for organizations with strict data policies while simplifying HIPAA, GDPR, and SOC 2 compliance requirements.
