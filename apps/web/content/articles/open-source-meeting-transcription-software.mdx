## Top Open-Source Meeting Transcription Software: Detailed Reviews

### 1. Char

[Char](/) is an open-source AI notepad for meetings that gives you complete control over your data and AI stack. Everything is stored as plain markdown files.

The interface works like Apple Notes. You open it and start typing. No list of past meetings to navigate, no calendar integration. Just a blank canvas ready to use.

While you're writing, Char listens to both your microphone and system audio. Once the meeting ends, it enhances your manual notes into actionable AI summaries based on your chosen template.

**Available as:** Native Mac app (desktop application, Windows coming soon)

## Which Open-Source Transcription Tool Should You Choose?

For most developers and privacy-conscious professionals, **Char** stands out. It delivers zero lock-in with complete control over your data and AI stack. Plain markdown files work with any tool, you choose your AI provider, and the manual note integration gives you control over what the AI focuses on.

The code is open source (GPL-3.0), so you can verify exactly how your data is processed. Need enterprise deployment? Self-host it on your own infrastructure. Want to modify the summarization logic? Fork it and make it yours.

Setup is straightforward. No complex configuration, no security warnings to bypass, no hidden dependencies.

Ready to try it? [Download Char for macOS](/download) or [check out the source code on GitHub](https://github.com/fastrepl/char).

## Frequently Asked Questions

### 1. Are open-source transcription tools really free?

Yes, all three are open source. Char and Amical are free for all users. Char is free forever for local transcription and BYOK. The managed cloud service is $8/month, and Enterprise tier has custom pricing.

Meetily is free for individual users under the MIT license. Organizations (2-100 users) and enterprises (100+ users) can request custom plans, but pricing isn't publicly listed.

### 2. Do I need a powerful computer to run local transcription software?

You need a reasonably modern machine. An M-series Mac works best for Char, though Intel Macs function with reduced performance. Meetily and Amical have similar requirements—at least 8GB RAM (16GB recommended) and a decent CPU. GPU acceleration helps but isn't required for basic use.

### 3. Can I use these tools offline?

Yes. All three can transcribe meetings completely offline using local AI models. You only need internet if you choose to use cloud AI providers for enhanced summaries.

### 4. How accurate is the transcription?

With larger Whisper models, accuracy typically reaches 90-95% for clear English audio. Accuracy drops with background noise, heavy accents, or specialized terminology. Custom vocabulary features (where available) can improve accuracy for industry-specific terms.

### 5. What about HIPAA, GDPR, and compliance?

Because processing happens locally by default, these tools simplify compliance significantly. Your data doesn't leave your device, so you're not transmitting protected information to third-party processors. This makes HIPAA, GDPR, SOC 2, and other frameworks much easier to satisfy.

Organizations needing formal compliance documentation can use Char or Meetily's enterprise plans, which include dedicated support.
