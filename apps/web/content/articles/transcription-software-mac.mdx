This guide covers transcription software built for macOS, whether you need real-time meeting transcription, batch file processing, or podcast editing with built-in transcription.

## How We Evaluated These Tools

We tested each tool on M1, M2, and Intel Macs to assess:

- **Native Mac experience**: Does it feel like a Mac app or a web wrapper?
- **Apple Silicon optimization**: Does it leverage M-series chips for faster processing?
- **Privacy and data handling**: Where does your audio go?
- **Transcription accuracy**: How well does it handle accents, technical terms, and multiple speakers?
- **Real-world usability**: Free tier limitations, export options, and workflow integration

## Best Transcription Software for Mac: Detailed Reviews

### 1. Char: Best for Privacy and Unlimited Local Transcription

[Char](/) is an open-source AI notepad for meetings built for Mac. Everything is stored as plain markdown files on your device. You choose your AI stack: managed cloud, BYOK, or run local models. Zero lock-in.

It works as both a real-time meeting assistant and a file transcription tool. Connect it to any meeting platform (Zoom, Teams, Meet, or in-person conversations), and it transcribes while you focus on the conversation.

#### What Makes It Stand Out on Mac

- **Apple Silicon optimized**: Runs Whisper models efficiently on M1/M2/M3 chips
- **Native macOS app**: Feels like a proper Mac application, not a web wrapper
- **Works offline**: Transcribe anywhere without internet dependency
- **Open source**: Full transparency about how your data is handled

#### What's Free

- Unlimited transcription with no monthly caps
- Real-time transcription during meetings
- AI-powered meeting summaries
- Export as Markdown, PDF, or Rich Text
- Custom vocabulary support

#### Managed Cloud ($8/month)

- Unlimited AI chat with your transcripts
- Custom template building
- Advanced search capabilities

**Best for**: Professionals handling sensitive conversations who need unlimited, private transcription.

### 2. MacWhisper: Best for Simple File Transcription

[MacWhisper](https://goodsnooze.gumroad.com/l/macwhisper) wraps OpenAI's Whisper technology in a simple drag-and-drop interface built specifically for Mac. If you just need to transcribe audio files without the complexity of a full meeting assistant, MacWhisper delivers.

The app processes everything locally on your Mac. Drop in an audio file, select a model size based on accuracy versus speed needs, and get your transcript with synced audio playback.

#### Performance on Mac

Performance depends on your hardware. Apple Silicon Macs handle transcription smoothly, processing files at roughly 15x real-time speed. A 27-minute video with three speakers transcribes in about 2 minutes on an M2 Max.

Intel Macs work but run significantly slower, especially with larger models that require more than 8GB RAM.

#### MacWhisper 12 Update (2025)

The latest version adds automatic speaker recognition, making it the first Mac app to offer this feature locally on-device. When you transcribe conversations, MacWhisper automatically detects different speakers and groups their speech.

#### What's Free

- Unlimited transcriptions
- Tiny, Base, and Small Whisper models
- Zero lock-in, plain markdown files
- 100+ language support
- Export as SRT, VTT, or TXT

#### When You'll Need Pro ($29-79 one-time)

- Medium, Large, and Large-V3 models for better accuracy
- Batch processing for multiple files
- Speaker identification
- System audio capture for Zoom/Teams meetings
- Word, PDF, and HTML exports

**Best for**: Users who need straightforward file transcription without subscriptions.

### 3. Descript: Best for Podcast and Video Editing

[Descript](https://www.descript.com) isn't just transcription software. It's an audio/video editor that uses transcription as its core editing interface. Edit your podcast or video by editing the text transcript.

Delete a sentence from the transcript, and it removes that audio from your recording. This text-based approach eliminates timeline scrubbing.

#### Mac-Specific Considerations

Descript runs as a native Mac app with decent Apple Silicon support, though it's more resource-intensive than simpler transcription tools. Expect it to use significant CPU and RAM during editing sessions.

#### What's Free

- 1 hour of transcription per month
- Basic editing features
- Screen recording
- 720p video export (watermarked)
- 5GB cloud storage

#### Paid Plans

- **Hobbyist** ($12/month): 10 hours transcription, 1080p export
- **Creator** ($24/month): 30 hours transcription, 4K export, filler word removal
- **Business** ($40/month): Everything in Creator plus team features

**Best for**: Podcasters and video creators who want to edit by editing text.

### 4. Otter.ai: Best for Automated Meeting Transcription

[Otter.ai](https://otter.ai) is one of the most popular meeting transcription tools. Its bot (OtterPilot) automatically joins your Zoom, Teams, and Google Meet calls based on your calendar, records everything, and shares notes afterward.

The trade-off is clear: you gain convenience by sending all conversations to Otter's cloud servers for processing.

#### Mac Experience

Otter works primarily through their web app and browser extensions. The Mac app is essentially a web wrapper. Don't expect native macOS feel or Apple Silicon optimization.

#### What's Free

- 300 minutes per month
- 30-minute max per conversation
- Live transcription in English, Spanish, French
- Automatic meeting bot
- 25 most recent conversations stored

#### When You'll Need to Pay

- **Pro** ($16.99/month): 1,200 minutes, 90-minute conversations
- **Business** ($30/month): 6,000 minutes, 4-hour meetings, CRM integrations

**Best for**: Teams who want automated meeting capture and don't mind cloud processing.

### 5. Notta: Best for Multi-Language Transcription

[Notta](https://www.notta.ai) supports 58 languages for transcription and 42 for translation, making it the strongest choice for multilingual teams. Like Otter, it uses a meeting bot to automatically join and transcribe calls.

#### Mac Experience

Notta offers a Mac app alongside their web interface. The app is functional but not particularly Mac-native in feel. Processing happens in the cloud.

#### What's Free

- 120 minutes per month
- 3-minute max per recording (severely limiting)
- 50 file uploads per month
- Live transcription for Zoom, Teams, Meet, Webex

#### When You'll Need to Pay

- **Pro** ($13.49/month): 1,800 minutes, 5-hour recordings, translation features
- **Business** ($27.99/month): Unlimited transcription, CRM integrations

**Best for**: Teams working across multiple languages who need translation alongside transcription.

### 6. Rev: Best for Human Transcription Accuracy

[Rev](https://www.rev.com) offers something unique: the option to have humans transcribe your audio for 99% accuracy. Their AI transcription is also available at lower cost, but the human option sets them apart.

#### Pricing Model

Rev uses a different pricing structure than most competitors:

- **AI transcription**: $0.25/minute
- **Human transcription**: $1.99/minute (99% accuracy, 24-hour turnaround)
- **Subscription**: $29.99/month for 20 hours of AI transcription

#### Mac Experience

Rev is primarily web-based. Upload files through their website, and download transcripts when ready. No native Mac app.

**Best for**: Legal, medical, or other professionals who need guaranteed accuracy and can't risk AI errors.

### 7. Sonix: Best for Subtitles and Translation

[Sonix](https://sonix.ai) focuses on transcription plus automated subtitles and translation. It supports 53+ languages for transcription and can translate into 54+ languages.

The platform is popular with video producers who need subtitles in multiple languages without hiring translators for each version.

#### Mac Experience

Sonix is entirely web-based. All editing happens in their browser-based editor, which works fine on Mac but isn't a native experience.

#### Pricing

- 30-minute free trial (one-time, not monthly)
- $10/hour pay-as-you-go
- $22/month subscription includes 2 hours

**Best for**: Video producers who need automated subtitles in multiple languages.

## Local vs Cloud: What's the Real Difference?

The biggest decision when choosing Mac transcription software is where your audio gets processed.

### Local Processing (Char, MacWhisper)

**Pros:**
- Complete privacy (audio never leaves your device)
- Works offline
- No ongoing subscription required
- No data used for AI training
- Simpler compliance for sensitive industries

**Cons:**
- Requires capable hardware (Apple Silicon recommended)
- Model downloads can be large (1-6GB)
- Speaker identification is harder locally

### Cloud Processing (Otter, Notta, Descript, Rev, Sonix)

**Pros:**
- Works on any hardware
- Often includes collaboration features
- Speaker identification is generally better
- Continuous model improvements without updates

**Cons:**
- Requires internet connection
- Audio sent to third-party servers
- Ongoing subscription costs
- Privacy policies vary (some use data for training)

## Which Transcription Software Should You Choose?

**Char** works best if you handle sensitive conversations, want unlimited local transcription, and prefer open-source transparency. The Mac-native experience and Apple Silicon optimization make it feel like it belongs on your Mac.

**MacWhisper** suits you if you need simple file transcription without meeting assistant features. The one-time payment model beats subscription fatigue.

**Descript** is right for editing podcasts or videos through text. The transcription serves the editing workflow.

**Otter** makes sense if you live in scheduled meetings and want automatic capture without thinking about it. Accept that your conversations go to the cloud.

**Notta** fits teams working across multiple languages that need both transcription and translation.

**Rev** works for legal, medical, or other critical transcripts where guaranteed accuracy matters. The human option justifies the premium.

**Sonix** suits video producers who need subtitles in multiple languages.

## Our Recommendation

For most Mac users who care about privacy and want a tool that actually feels like a Mac app, **Char** offers the best combination of unlimited local transcription, real-time meeting support, and native macOS experience.

If you just need occasional file transcription without meeting features, **MacWhisper** is solid with its one-time payment.

For teams who prioritize automation over privacy, **Otter** or **Notta** provide the meeting bot experience, though all conversations go to the cloud.
