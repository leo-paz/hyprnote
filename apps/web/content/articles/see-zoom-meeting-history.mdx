Need to find a past Zoom meeting? Whether you're tracking attendance, checking when a call happened, or looking up a meeting ID, Zoom's meeting history can help. Here's how to access it.

## How to Access Your Zoom Meeting History

Zoom offers a few ways to view your meeting history, depending on whether you hosted or joined the meeting.

### For Meetings You Hosted

<Image src="/api/images/blog/see-zoom-meeting-history/zoom-1.png" alt="Zoom dashboard" />

If you're the meeting host, accessing your history is straightforward:

1. Sign in to the [Zoom web portal](https://zoom.us/)
2. Click **Meetings** in the navigation menu, then select **Previous**
3. Use the date range filters if you're looking for something specific

Your account admin and owner can also see this information. If a meeting ID has expired (which happens based on [Zoom's expiration rules](https://support.zoom.com/hc/en/article?id=zm_kb&sysparm_article=KB0060761)), it won't show up in your list anymore.

### For Meetings You Joined

You can only see meetings you've joined through the Zoom desktop app, with significant limitations:

1. Open the Zoom desktop app
2. Click **Join**
3. Click the dropdown arrow in the Meeting ID field

You'll see your last 10 meetings with a partial meeting topic and the meeting ID. There are no full details, no reliable timestamps, and this list doesn't sync across devices. If you joined a meeting on your laptop, you won't see it in your phone's history.

### Using Zoom Reporting for Advanced History

If you're on a Pro, Business, Enterprise, or Education account, you can access Zoom's reporting features. Account owners and admins can generate reports showing:

- Active meetings during specific time ranges (up to one month)
- Meeting minutes and participant lists
- User activity reports

These reports can go back 12 months, which helps with compliance or attendance tracking. Meetings must be hosted by a paid account, and upgrading your account won't retroactively create reports for past meetings.

## What Information Does Zoom Meeting History Actually Show?

Zoom's meeting history tells you when meetings happened, who attended, how long they lasted, and the meeting IDs and basic settings.

It doesn't tell you what was actually discussed, what decisions were made, what action items came up, or the context of any conversation.

You can see that you had a meeting with Sarah on October 15th at 2 PM, but unless you took detailed notes during the call, you have no way to remember what was discussed. Meeting history shows proof that a meeting occurred—metadata—but not what actually happened in it.

Zoom was designed to help admins track usage and generate compliance reports. It wasn't designed to help you remember meeting content. If you spend hours in meetings every day—in customer success, sales, consulting, recruiting, or similar roles—you need more than proof of meetings. You need to remember what was actually said. This is where [AI note-takers for Zoom](/blog/best-ai-notetaker-for-zoom), like Char, can help.

## How Char Changes Meeting History

Char is an open-source [AI notepad](/) for meetings that gives you complete control over your data and AI stack. Instead of just logging when meetings happened, it captures what actually occurred—stored as plain markdown files with zero lock-in.

### 1. Search Through Actual Conversations

<Image src="/api/images/blog/see-zoom-meeting-history/zoom-2.png" alt="Search" />

With Char, you can search for any keyword and find it within your meeting transcripts. Press `cmd + k` to open the search palette and type anything—a person's name, a project code, a specific topic.

The search shows you the actual context: what was said, by whom, and when in the conversation. You can filter by person to see all meetings with a specific colleague or client.

If you search for "budget," you're not getting a list of 47 meetings that might have mentioned budget somewhere. You're getting the exact moments where budget was discussed, with full context around each mention.

### 2. Ask Questions About Your Meetings

<Image src="/api/images/blog/see-zoom-meeting-history/zoom-3.png" alt="Chat" />

Sometimes you don't know the exact keyword to search for. You just have a vague memory that someone said something important.

Char's AI Chat lets you ask natural language questions like:

- "What are my action items from this week's meetings?"
- "What did Richard say about installing more servers?"
- "Bring up notes related to the product launch"

The AI searches through your transcripts and summaries to answer. You can mention specific people or notes using "@" to pull them into context.

### 3. Visual Meeting Organization

Char's Finder feature includes three views:

**Calendar View:** See your meetings laid out visually by date, just like your calendar app. Click any event to see the full note and transcript.

**Table View:** A spreadsheet-style layout for scanning through large amounts of meeting data quickly.

<Image src="/api/images/blog/see-zoom-meeting-history/zoom-5.png" alt="Table" />

**Contacts View:** See all your contacts and filter meetings by organization. Want to see every conversation you've had with a particular company? It's all there.

Each view gives you a different way to approach your conversation history: by time, by relationship, or by project.

### 4. Verify What Was Actually Said

<Image src="/api/images/blog/see-zoom-meeting-history/zoom-7.webp" alt="Annotation" />

Ever read an AI summary and wonder if someone really said that? Char's Source Analysis feature lets you hover over any part of your meeting summary to see the exact quote from the transcript.

This matters for client meetings where you need to quote exact requirements, negotiations where precise wording matters, or compliance situations where you need to verify what was discussed. You get AI summarization with the accuracy of checking the source.

## How Char Works with Zoom (and Every Other Platform)

Char runs entirely on your Mac, capturing audio from both your microphone and your system audio. This means it works with Zoom, Teams, Google Meet, or any other platform without bots or meeting interruptions.

During your meeting, real-time transcription powered by Whisper models captures everything being said. When the meeting ends, Char generates a structured summary with action items, key decisions, and discussion points using our custom HyperLLM-V1 model. Everything stays local on your device—no audio uploaded, no transcripts sent to external servers, no compliance concerns about where your data lives.

Key features for Zoom users:

- **Bot-free recording:** Works silently in the background without joining your meeting as a participant
- **Universal compatibility:** Captures both virtual Zoom calls and in-person meetings
- **Offline capable:** Transcription and summarization work even without internet connection
- **Privacy-first:** Makes HIPAA, GDPR, SOC 2 compliance simple by eliminating cloud dependencies
- **Flexible AI options:** Go fully local, connect to OpenAI/Mistral/Ollama, or use custom endpoints

For organizations in healthcare, legal, finance, or any compliance-sensitive industry, this approach matters. You can have AI-powered meeting intelligence while meeting regulatory requirements. For everyone else, you get meeting history that actually works the way your brain works—by content and context.
