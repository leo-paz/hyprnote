I am a big believer in jotting things down. 

If I have an idea, I capture it. The problem is I capture everything. At one point, my note-taking app had so many half-baked ideas that nothing made sense anymore. Then AI changed that.

Those random notes could suddenly be summarized, searched, and connected. I could ask questions across everything I'd written. Turn messy thoughts into clear insights. Find an idea from three months ago in seconds. It's made a real difference.

But AI note-taking apps aren't all built the same.

I've spent considerable time testing these tools. I even built one myself. If you're looking for an AI note-taking app, I've done the research. This guide breaks down the popular options so you can pick the right one.

## What Is an AI Note Taker?

An AI note taker uses artificial intelligence to help you capture, organize, and make sense of information. It applies large language models to turn raw input—typed notes, voice recordings, or transcribed conversations—into something useful.

The best ones do more than transcribe or summarize. They let you search across everything you've captured, connect related ideas, answer questions about your notes, and surface insights you'd find difficult to locate manually. The AI extends your note-taking workflow rather than replacing it.

## Types of AI Note Takers

### Speech-to-text AI Note Takers

These tools target calls and meetings. They use speech-to-text models like Whisper to transcribe conversations in real-time, then apply AI to generate summaries, action items, and key takeaways.

Some join meetings as bots (Otter), while others record your system audio directly (Char, Granola, Fathom). The output includes transcripts, summaries, and searchable recordings of what was discussed.

### PKM Note-Taking Apps with AI

Notion and Obsidian were built for personal knowledge management, not meetings—a place to externalize your thinking. They've added AI features to help you write, organize, search, and connect ideas across your notes.

The AI assists with drafting, summarizing long documents, answering questions about your knowledge base, and surfacing related notes. These tools work with whatever you type, not just meeting audio.

## Reviews of the Best AI Note Taker Apps

### 1. Char - Best Free AI Note-Taking App

![](https://auth.hyprnote.com/storage/v1/object/public/blog/articles/best-ai-notetaker/1768756074373-image-1.png)

I'm Char's founder. I'm putting my tool first, though I'll explain why rather than asking you to trust me.

Every AI note-taking tool I tested before building [Char](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://char.com/&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1768759307552236&usg=AOvVaw1mbgP0wxtMwkRVvxunIkkE) forced the same choice: use their cloud, their models, their rules. My data went where they decided, stored how they decided. No way to switch, no way out.

Char exists because of that. It's an open-source AI notepad for meetings that stores everything as plain markdown files on your device. Zero lock-in. You choose your AI stack: managed cloud, bring your own API keys, or run local models. No bots. No vendor dependency.

Want better AI? Plug in your own OpenAI, Mistral, or any endpoint you prefer. Your files, your AI, your workflow.

This works best for engineers and developers who want files over apps, companies where cloud tools like Otter are banned, privacy-conscious professionals in healthcare and legal, or anyone who refuses to compromise on control.

#### Key Features:

- Plain markdown files: Stored locally, works with any tool (Obsidian, Notion, VS Code)—zero lock-in
- Your choice of AI stack: Managed cloud, bring your own API keys, or run local models via Ollama
- Universal meeting compatibility: Works with Zoom, Teams, Meet, and every other platform without bots—system audio capture, no calendar permissions
- Works offline: Take notes, record, and transcribe without internet connectivity
- Open-source: Inspect the code, contribute, or customize. Zero vendor lock-in
- Enterprise deployment: On-prem, VPC, or hybrid options with SSO, consent management, and admin controls
- Custom templates: Tailored formats for therapy sessions, legal meetings, job interviews, or casual coffee chats
- Search your meeting history: Ask "What did Sarah say about the budget?" instead of scrolling through months of notes
- AI chat: Get immediate answers about action items, deadlines, or who said what during meetings
- AI autonomy control: Choose how much AI changes your notes—minimal improvements to your original thoughts or complete AI restructuring
- Source analysis: Hover over summaries to see the exact transcript quote behind every AI-generated point

#### Pros:

- Free forever for local transcription, BYOK, and all core features
- Zero lock-in—switch AI providers anytime, export files anywhere
- IT teams can audit the code and approve the AI provider
- Real notepad experience from the moment you open it

#### Cons:

- macOS only (Windows and iOS app coming soon)
- Manual speaker tagging required (Speaker identification coming soon)
- No video recording

#### Pricing:

Char is free forever for local transcription, BYOK, and all core features. Managed cloud service is $8/month for the easiest setup without managing API keys.

### 2. Obsidian with AI Plugins - Best for Knowledge Management

![](https://auth.hyprnote.com/storage/v1/object/public/blog/articles/best-ai-notetaker/1768756074976-image-2.png)

I'm drawn to [Obsidian](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://obsidian.md/&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1768759307556808&usg=AOvVaw3iVOX-hmrHgHJ6pcIa6TfH). Their [file over app](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://stephango.com/file-over-app&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1768759307556926&usg=AOvVaw3EJOrTCKjM4peWuUy6ed1E) philosophy resonates—everything is plain markdown files on your device. If Obsidian shuts down tomorrow, your notes survive.

It's not an AI note taker out of the box. AI features come through [plugins](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://obsidian.md/plugins?search%3Dai&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1768759307557306&usg=AOvVaw1daGV8gnfslZA2Wx03ffID).

The tradeoff is significant. You're building a system, not using an app. Every feature needs a plugin, documentation, setup. I've lost weekends to theme tweaking instead of writing. It's powerful when it works, exhausting when it doesn't.

#### Key Features:

- Local markdown files—you own your data completely
- 2,700+ community plugins for every use case imaginable
- AI capabilities through plugins (Copilot, Smart Connections, AI Chat)
- Graph view for visualizing connections between notes
- Works offline, syncs across devices (paid Sync add-on or DIY)
- Integrates with Zotero, Todoist, and other tools via plugins

#### Pros:

- True data ownership
- Incredibly powerful for linking ideas and building knowledge graphs
- Active community building plugins constantly
- Works on Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android
- Local-first with optional cloud sync

#### Cons:

- Steep learning curve—you're building a system, not using an app
- AI features require plugin setup and maintenance
- Can become a productivity procrastination trap (endless tweaking)
- Not visually polished out of the box, requires theme hunting
- Markdown editing can feel clunky for rich media
- Plugin dependency means features can break or get abandoned
- Overwhelming for simple note-taking needs

#### Pricing:

Free core app with optional paid services (Sync $5/month, Publish $10/month)

### 3. Granola: Best for Active Note Takers During Meetings

![](https://auth.hyprnote.com/storage/v1/object/public/blog/articles/best-ai-notetaker/1768756075258-image-3.png)

[Granola](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.granola.ai/&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1768759307559871&usg=AOvVaw3Ys71lW9lb82dHCgYguOEj) is an AI-powered notepad for people who want to take their own notes while getting intelligent assistance to make them comprehensive.

Like Char, it captures audio directly from your device. Unlike Char, it sends your data to the cloud for AI processing, which creates privacy concerns for organizations with strict compliance requirements.

#### Key Features:

- Hybrid approach: combines your manual notes with AI transcription
- Bot-free recording—captures system audio directly
- Granola Chat lets you ask questions across all your meetings
- Customizable templates for different meeting types
- "Recipes" for one-click complex prompts (PRD generation, leadership coaching)
- Works on Mac and iPhone, integrates with Notion, Slack, HubSpot, Attio

#### Pros:

- Familiar notepad interface similar to Apple Notes
- No complex setup required
- Works across all video conferencing platforms by capturing device audio directly
- Notes ready almost immediately after the meeting ends

#### Cons:

- Requires active note-taking during meetings to be most effective
- No video recording, only provides transcripts and summaries
- No permanent free tier after the 25-meeting trial period

#### Pricing:

Offers a free plan with limited meeting notes. Paid plans start at $14/month.

### 4. Notion - Best if You Already Live in Notion

![](https://auth.hyprnote.com/storage/v1/object/public/blog/articles/best-ai-notetaker/1768756075572-image-4.png)

[Notion](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.notion.com/product/ai&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1768759307562073&usg=AOvVaw3xCK0DnPNr8VfeqsUU-3ag) is an all-in-one workspace tool that now includes AI—chat that searches your workspace, writing assistance that drafts and edits, and meeting transcription without bots. The appeal is avoiding tool switching.

The problem is that AI feels added on rather than essential. Notion wasn't designed for note-taking. The block system is awkward. Mobile performance lags. Most people capture notes elsewhere, then organize in Notion. The AI helps with organization (search, summaries), but you'll run into limitations. Free and paid plans include limited AI trials.

#### Key Features:

- AI Meeting Notes (transcription, summaries, action items) without bots
- Databases with custom properties, views, and filters
- Real-time collaboration with inline comments
- Customizable templates for every use case
- Publish pages to the web as websites
- Integrations with Slack, HubSpot, Zapier, and more

#### Pros:

- True all-in-one platform (notes, tasks, wikis, databases)
- Excellent for team collaboration and knowledge management
- Free tier is genuinely useful for individuals
- Cross-platform (web, Windows, Mac, iOS, Android)
- AI features built in (chat, generate, autofill, meeting notes)
- Strong ecosystem of templates and integrations

#### Cons:

- Awkward for actual note-taking (block system fights quick capture)
- Slow performance, especially mobile
- Steep learning curve for advanced features
- Can become overwhelming (tries to do everything)
- Data lives on their servers

#### Pricing:

You'll need Notion's $24/month Business Plan to use AI features.

### 5. Fathom: Best for Sales Teams

![](https://auth.hyprnote.com/storage/v1/object/public/blog/articles/best-ai-notetaker/1768756076236-image-5.png)

[Fathom](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.fathom.ai/&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1768759307564997&usg=AOvVaw21POtCwmzAEeV4BYAHQQQ2) is built for sales teams who need meeting notes synced to CRM automatically. It records, transcribes, summarizes, but the real value comes from pushing everything to Salesforce, HubSpot, or Close without manual work. Sales calls land in your pipeline with action items already logged.

#### Key Features:

- Auto-sync to Salesforce, HubSpot, Close CRM
- "Ask Fathom" conversational AI across all calls
- Coaching metrics and AI scorecards for sales performance
- Deal View summarizing insights across multiple calls
- Custom vocabularies for industry jargon
- Integrates with Slack, Asana, Zapier, Notion

#### Pros:

- Deep CRM integrations (not just basic sync)
- Conversation intelligence built for sales
- Accurate transcription handles accents well
- Generous free tier to test
- Strong customer support (5/5 on [G2](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.g2.com/products/fathom-video/reviews?page%3D2%23reviews&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1768759307566376&usg=AOvVaw3nZnjixlnAFI50kHMLaDs2) from 6,345 reviews)

#### Cons:

- Does not work offline or for in-person meetings
- Bot presence in the calls may feel intrusive
- Advanced AI features require paid plans

#### Pricing:

A generous free tier includes basic CRM sync. Team $18/month/user (minimum 2 users) adds collaboration. Business $28/month/user unlocks full CRM field sync, Deal View, and coaching metrics. There's also a $20/month plan with integrations and advanced AI but without collaboration and coaching features.

### 6. Reflect: Best for People Who Found Obsidian Too Complex and Notion Too Slow

![](https://auth.hyprnote.com/storage/v1/object/public/blog/articles/best-ai-notetaker/1768756076581-image-6.png)

[Reflect](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://reflect.app/&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1768759307567541&usg=AOvVaw1PCJnKZNiP0tu7xN0mhzXX) is a daily notes app with backlinks and AI. You get a new note each day. You write. It links. The AI (GPT-4 and Whisper) can transcribe voice notes, generate summaries, answer questions about your notes. Google Calendar integration puts your meetings in the sidebar, ready for notes.

It's built for people who think in connections rather than folders. Everything is chronological by default. Backlinks surface automatically. End-to-end encryption means only you read your notes. Fast, minimal, opinionated—there's essentially one way to use it.

#### Key Features:

- Daily notes with automatic backlinks
- AI chat, summaries, and voice transcription (GPT-4 and Whisper)
- Google Calendar and Outlook integration
- End-to-end encryption
- Chrome web clipper and Kindle sync
- Cross-platform sync (iOS/web)

#### Pros:

- Fast, noticeably faster than Notion or Roam
- Simple without being limiting
- AI feels integrated, not tacked on
- Encrypted without sacrificing features
- Responsive team shipping constantly

#### Cons:

- No Android (mobile web is bad)
- Yearly payment only ($120, no monthly)
- No collaboration features by design
- iOS/web only (no Windows/Linux desktop)
- More expensive than alternatives

#### Pricing:

$10/month (must pay $120 annually). 14-day free trial.

### 7. Otter AI: Best if You're Looking for a Feature-rich Solution

![](https://auth.hyprnote.com/storage/v1/object/public/blog/articles/best-ai-notetaker/1768756076836-image-7.png)

[Otter](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://otter.ai/&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1768759307570156&usg=AOvVaw1ShKuIeVNtQTONf80caVdW) has been in the AI note-taking space longer than most competitors. The product is feature-rich with extensive integrations (Salesforce, HubSpot, Slack, Notion) and solid team collaboration tools. The bot joins your meetings, transcribes, learns speaker voices, captures slides automatically. AI chat lets you query transcripts.

However, there are significant concerns. A [federal lawsuit](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://char.com/blog/is-otter-ai-safe&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1768759307570691&usg=AOvVaw0K9CMyUVDW7YMeCT8Vgoa1) alleges Otter records without proper consent. Users report the bot automatically inviting colleagues and joining meetings uninvited. Transcripts get shared externally. Customer support is slow and account cancellations are difficult. Your data gets shared with third parties for AI training. The free tier is deliberately limited to push users toward paid plans.

If you're comfortable with cloud-only recording, bot-based capture, and the privacy tradeoffs, Otter delivers on features. If data control matters or you work with sensitive information, the problems outweigh the polish.

#### Key Features:

- Automated transcription (bot joins Zoom, Teams, Google Meet)
- AI chat across meeting transcripts
- Slide and screen capture during meetings
- Speaker identification (learns voices over time)
- Integrations with Salesforce, HubSpot, Slack, Notion
- Mobile apps (iOS/Android)

#### Pros:

- Established, reliable transcription
- Works with major platforms
- AI chat is useful for querying past meetings
- Free tier exists (limited but usable)
- Team collaboration features

#### Cons:

- Federal lawsuit over unauthorized recording practices
- Automatically invites colleagues and joins meetings without permission
- Shares data with third parties for AI training
- Customer support is extremely slow
- Account deletion doesn't actually delete (fake deletions)
- Billing traps (non-refundable, misleading plan differences)
- Internet-dependent (no offline functionality)
- Restrictive free tier (300 min/month)

#### Pricing:

Free tier is 300 min/month, Pro is $17/month, Business is $30/month where most teams end up.

### 8. Mem AI - Best for Self-Organizing Notes

![](https://auth.hyprnote.com/storage/v1/object/public/blog/articles/best-ai-notetaker/1768756077113-image-8.png)

[Mem.ai](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://mem.ai&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1768759307573576&usg=AOvVaw2oU1hLmiagi83BTjnTt5Ng) is built on one principle: you shouldn't have to organize notes.

Dump everything in—voice notes, meeting transcripts, web clips, random thoughts—and AI handles the filing.

Mem 2.0 brought improvements (faster, better AI), but my review is mixed. I like the hands-off approach, but the AI sometimes connects things that aren't related.

#### Key Features:

- Voice notes with transcription (turn brain dumps into notes)
- Meeting recording and transcription
- AI-powered Collections (auto-organize by topic)
- Heads Up (surfaces related notes automatically as you write)
- Mem Chat (ask questions, generate content from your notes)
- Chrome extension for web clipping

#### Pros:

- Truly zero manual organization required
- Fast interface, minimal design
- Voice and meeting features work well
- Good at retrieving information with AI
- Works across devices (Mac, Windows, iOS, web)

#### Cons:

- Free tier is useless (25 notes/month)
- No Android app
- Slow development (features lag behind competitors)
- AI over-relates things that aren't related
- Can't export individual notes as markdown
- Tab system confusing (opens many tabs unknowingly)
- Internet required for AI features

#### Pricing:

Offers a free tier, but real use requires Pro at $12/month.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### 1. Can I use AI for note-taking?

Yes. AI note-taking tools transcribe conversations, generate summaries, extract action items, and help you search across everything you've captured. They're particularly useful for meetings, lectures, interviews, or anytime you need to focus on the conversation instead of frantically typing notes.

The right tool depends on your needs. If you want zero lock-in and complete control, use Char. If you need CRM integration, use something built for sales (Fathom). If you want AI to organize your messy thoughts, try Mem.ai.

### 2. Can ChatGPT take notes?

ChatGPT can help you organize and summarize notes you've already taken, but it can't record or transcribe meetings. You'd need to feed it text manually—paste in a transcript, ask it to summarize or extract action items.

For actual meeting transcription and note-taking, you need dedicated tools like Char, Otter, or Granola that capture audio and transcribe in real-time. Some of these tools use GPT-4 for summarization, but the recording and transcription happens separately.

### 3. Is AI note-taker legal?

Yes, [AI note-takers are legal](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://char.com/blog/is-ai-notetaking-legal&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1768759307577317&usg=AOvVaw1O0eqNoCNJpz_Sg7PM4Vei), but recording conversations has legal requirements depending on your location. In the US, some states require "two-party consent" (everyone must agree to be recorded), while others only need "one-party consent" (you can record if you're part of the conversation).

The legal risk comes from recording without consent, not from using AI. Tools like Otter and Fireflies that join meetings as bots make it obvious you're recording. Tools like Char and Granola that capture system audio are invisible—so you need to tell people you're recording.

For work meetings, check your company's policy. For healthcare, legal, or finance, look for tools that handle consent properly (Char has consent management for enterprise).

### 4. Which AI note-taking app doesn't join video calls?

Char records your microphone and system audio directly on your Mac. No bot, no cloud dependency, everything stored as plain markdown files you own.

Bot-based tools like Otter, Fireflies, and most meeting-focused AI note-takers join as visible participants. If you want invisible recording, use Char—just make sure you tell people you're recording.

### 5. Can AI be 100% trusted?

No. AI makes mistakes—hallucinations, incorrect summaries, missed context. Always review AI-generated notes, especially for important meetings or decisions.

That said, AI transcription accuracy is generally 85-95% with good audio quality.

### 6. Which AI note taker is secure?

Char gives you complete control because everything is stored as plain markdown files on your device. You choose which AI processes your data—or keep it fully local. IT teams can audit the open-source code, and you can use the AI provider your security team approves.

Avoid tools with known security issues. Otter has a federal lawsuit about unauthorized recording. Fireflies has reports of bots joining meetings after account deletion. If control matters, use an open-source tool with zero lock-in.
