## What Pro Includes

Pro gives you managed cloud AI that works out of the box — no API keys, no local GPU required.

| Feature | What You Get | Details |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| **Cloud Transcription** | Real-time speech-to-text via premium providers | Deepgram, Soniox, AssemblyAI, and more — automatically selected based on your language. See [Better Transcription](/docs/pro/better-transcription). |
| **Cloud Intelligence** | AI summaries, notes, and chat via curated LLMs | Kimi K2, GPT-5.2, Claude Haiku 4.5 — routed through OpenRouter for lowest latency. See [Cloud Services](/docs/pro/cloud). |
| **MCP Tools** | Web search and URL reading during AI note generation | Powered by Exa (search) and Jina AI (URL reading). See [Cloud Services](/docs/pro/cloud). |

**Privacy at a glance:**
- Char's servers **do not store** your audio, transcripts, or conversation content
- Your **user identity is never sent** to external AI providers
- All providers have **zero data retention** by default for streaming/API usage
- Analytics logs metadata only (model name, token count, duration) — **never content**
- Everything is [open source](https://github.com/fastrepl/hyprnote) — verify any claim in the code

For the complete data flow breakdown, see [AI Models & Data Privacy](/docs/faq/ai-models-and-privacy).
