## Native AI Notetaker Solutions for Microsoft Teams

Microsoft doesn't offer a free way to get AI-powered meeting notes, summaries, or intelligent transcription analysis from Teams. Teams users with Microsoft 365 Business or Enterprise get meeting transcription with speaker identification, but no AI summaries or intelligent note-taking.

### 1. Microsoft 365 Copilot: The Premium AI Assistant

<Image src="/api/images/blog/best-ai-notetaker-for-microsoft-teams/teams-2.webp" alt="Microsoft 365 Copilot" />

[Microsoft 365 Copilot](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/use-copilot-in-microsoft-teams-meetings-0bf9dd3c-96f7-44e2-8bb8-790bedf066b1) is an AI assistant that works across Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, and Teams, powered by large language models. For Teams specifically, it transforms how you handle meeting preparation, participation, and follow-up.

**Important Note:** Microsoft 365 Copilot is different from the [free Copilot](https://copilot.microsoft.com) available in browsers and Bing. Copilot does not record meetings itself—you need to provide it with a meeting transcription to generate a summary and AI notes.

#### Microsoft 365 Copilot's Teams Integration Features

- Cross-app integration across Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, and Teams
- Real-time meeting intelligence with context understanding and topic organization
- Intelligent summarization including decisions, action items, and participant insights

#### Pros

- Native integration eliminates compatibility issues
- Enterprise-grade security with Microsoft's compliance framework
- Cross-platform consistency across all Microsoft 365 apps

## Best Third-Party AI Notetakers for Microsoft Teams

While Microsoft's native solutions work well for many organizations, third-party tools often provide specialized features, better privacy controls, or more competitive pricing.

### 1. Char: The Zero Lock-in AI Notepad

Char is an open-source AI notepad for meetings built for high-agency people who demand complete control over their data and AI stack. Everything is stored as plain markdown files—not in proprietary databases.

**Full Disclosure:** I'm the co-founder of Char, so I'll try to be as objective as possible in this review.

**How It Works with Microsoft Teams:** Char doesn't join your Teams meetings as a bot. Instead, it captures both your microphone input and your computer's system audio, so it hears both sides of the conversation. It transcribes your call in real-time. After the meeting ends, you get structured summaries with decisions and action items automatically extracted. No bots to invite, no meeting links to manage.

<Image src="/api/images/blog/best-ai-notetaker-for-microsoft-teams/teams-4.webp" alt="best ai notetaker for microsoft teams" />

#### Key Features

- Multiple deployment options: keep everything on your device for maximum privacy, deploy on your own servers for compliance, or use cloud setup for convenience
- Complete local processing option with a custom HyperLLM-V1 model optimized for summarization quality
- Real-time transcription using Whisper models ranging from lightweight to highly accurate versions
- Universal platform compatibility works with Teams, Zoom, Google Meet, and in-person meetings without any setup
- Bot-free operation means no disruption to your meeting flow or participant experience
- Vendor flexibility connects to any AI provider, including OpenAI, Mistral, or custom endpoints

- Free forever for local transcription, BYOK, and all core features
- Open source codebase allows for inspection, customization, and community contributions
- Can work completely offline, making it perfect for air-gapped environments
- True file ownership—works with Obsidian, Notion, VS Code, anything

#### Cons

- macOS only currently (Windows or Linux versions coming soon)
- No video recording by design for maximum privacy
- Limited integrations compared to established players with extensive third-party ecosystems
- Basic speaker identification currently distinguishes only between microphone and system audio

#### Pricing

<Image src="/api/images/blog/best-ai-notetaker-for-microsoft-teams/teams-5.webp" alt="Char pricing" />

Char is [free forever](/blog/free-ai-notetakers) for local transcription, BYOK, and all core features. The managed cloud service is $8/month for the easiest setup. Enterprise applies when your organization needs on-premises deployment, SSO integration, or consent management for compliance requirements. [Contact sales for a quote](/founders).
