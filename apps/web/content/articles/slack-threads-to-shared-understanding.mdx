Something small but telling happened in our marketing channel.

Harshika asked: "How is Hyprnote's managed cloud different from Granola?"

That question kicked off a real discussion about what we believe.

## The thread

Yujong made a point. From a user's perspective, most "AI cloud" stories blur together. Infrastructure doesn't matter to them. The front-end, the workflow, the experience — that's what they compare.

The discussion went deeper. Open source. BYOK. Local-first. We realized we weren't debating features. We were circling taste and preference.

One person said: "It's more like Philz vs Peet's than anything technical." The comparison stuck.

## What happened next

After the thread cooled, I asked AI to consolidate the discussion and update our company handbook. It generated a PR on GitHub.

The thinking didn't stay trapped in Slack. It moved into a document, became a diff, and went through review. Now it's part of our institutional memory instead of buried in a channel.

## Why Slack threads die

Slack works well for real-time discussion but poorly for long-term memory.

A thread happens, people contribute, the discussion ends. A week later, someone asks the same question and the thread is buried three pages deep.

You end up having the same conversation over and over. The insights aren't lost — they're just unreachable.

## The loop we built

Conversations happen in Slack. When a discussion settles and produces something worth keeping, we feed the thread to AI. It generates a draft document. We review the draft in GitHub. We make edits. We merge.

Now the next person who has the same question can read the document instead of asking again.

Our company handbook lives in GitHub as markdown files. Every time we make a decision worth remembering, we update it. Every time someone asks a question the handbook should answer, we check it first.

## Why AI makes this possible

You can't just copy-paste a Slack thread into a document. It's too messy. Half the messages are tangential. Context is implied, not stated. Side conversations branch off and merge back.

AI reads the thread, extracts the key points, and writes a coherent summary. You review it, edit it, and merge it. The AI handles the synthesis; you make sure it captured what actually mattered.

Without this bridge, transcribing Slack threads into documents is too much work. Nobody does it consistently. With it, turning a discussion into a living document takes five minutes.

## Why this is hard to give up

Once you have this loop running, going back to Slack-only conversations feels broken. You notice when a good discussion happens and doesn't get captured.

The system isn't complicated. It's just a habit: when a conversation produces something worth keeping, write it down. AI made the "write it down" part fast enough that we actually do it.
