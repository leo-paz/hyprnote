### 2. Platform Compatibility

Granola currently supports Mac only and lacks mobile apps, which restricts usage on other devices or while traveling.

### 3. Integration Limitations

Granola doesn't integrate with popular workplace tools like Asana, ClickUp, or Zapier, which limits its usefulness for teams wanting to share notes automatically. We focused on tools with robust third-party integrations beyond basic calendar sync.

### 4. Missing Advanced Features

Granola doesn't record video or allow access to audio recordings, making it less suitable for hiring interviews or user research.

### 5. Value & Pricing Concerns

Granola's $18/month individual plan and limited free tier prompted us to look for alternatives offering better features-to-price ratios or more generous free plans for teams and individuals.
