When you run AI agents, there's dead time. Thirty seconds. Sometimes a minute or more.

Most people scroll Twitter, LinkedIn, or Slack during those gaps. I realized I was outsourcing my brain to AI but letting my body decay in a chair.

## What I changed

I started doing micro workouts during agent runs. Squats, lunges, push-ups, jumping jacks. Nothing fancy. Just movement.

The dead time stopped being wasted time. I wasn't reaching for my phone anymore.

## Making it automatic

I updated AGENTS.md to suggest exercise when an agent starts a task.

Now, every time I kick off an agent, I get a reminder. The compound effect adds up fast. More PRs means more reps. More code reviews means more movement.

## Why this works

Working with AI agents is different from writing code yourself. When you write code, you're in flow. Interruptions break the rhythm.

When you run an agent, you're waiting. The work is happening without you. You're not in flow — you're just sitting there. If you fill that gap with scrolling, you train yourself to reach for distraction every time there's a pause. If you fill it with movement, you build a different habit.

## What this looks like

I kick off an agent to fix a bug. I do 20 squats. The agent finishes. I review the PR. I kick off another agent to write tests. I do 15 push-ups. The agent finishes. I merge.

By the end of the day, I've done hundreds of reps without ever setting foot in a gym.

## The cue

No gym or equipment required — just a cue.

For me, the cue is the agent starting. For you, it could be a build compiling, a deploy running, or a test suite finishing. Anything that creates a 30-second-to-2-minute gap where you're not actively typing.

The point is to tie movement to something you already do. If you already run agents dozens of times a day, you already have dozens of cues. You just need to respond to them differently.

## A few weeks in

I'm stronger and less stiff. I don't sit for five-hour stretches without moving anymore.

I didn't set out to build a fitness routine. It's a side effect of one small change in my dev workflow, and I don't think I'm going back.
