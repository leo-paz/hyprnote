When we started building Char, we weren't naive about what we were walking into. Otter, Fireflies, Granola, the space was already crowded with well-funded players offering impressive features.

We could have tried to out-feature them by adding more integrations, shinier interfaces, and flashier AI capabilities. But we made reliability our absolute north star.

Why? Because IT teams were banning existing tools, users were anxious about data privacy, and most options were useless without an internet connection. We realized that what the market truly needed was an AI notetaker that people could use **confidently, anytime, anywhere**.

Now, I am not claiming that we have built the perfect platform, we're still on our way there. But, we definitely know what makes an AI note taker reliable, and more importantly, what makes one fail.

If you're evaluating note-taking tools and wondering which one won't let you down, here's what you need to know.

## How to Check the Reliability of an AI Notetaker?

In system design, we measure reliability by assessing the number of dependencies required for the core function to operate. Simply put: the fewer things your system needs to work, the more reliable it is.

Most AI notetakers today are built on stacks of dependencies. Knowing them helps you make a clear decision: which vulnerabilities can you strategically manage, and which are absolute deal breakers for your team?

Here are five places where AI note takers commonly introduce dependencies:

### 1. Network Dependency

Most AI note takers require internet connectivity to function. Not just to sync your notes later, but to process them in real time. The transcription happens in the cloud. The AI runs on remote servers. Without internet, the tool stops working entirely.

This dependency shows up in predictable places. Basement conference rooms where WiFi doesn't reach. Client sites with restricted networks. Airports between flights. Rural locations. Government facilities with security protocols. Hospitals with compliance-driven network restrictions.

These aren't edge cases. They're environments where critical conversations happen. When your note taker requires connectivity, it fails exactly when you need it most.

### 2. Vendor Dependency

Cloud-based AI note takers don't just need internet, they need specific services to be running. OpenAI's API. Azure's infrastructure. AWS endpoints. These are vendor dependencies, and they introduce risk you can't control.

In March 2023, OpenAI went down for several hours. Again in June 2024. When that happens, every tool built on their API stops working. It doesn't matter how good your product is or how much your users are paying. You're offline until the vendor comes back.

Vendor dependencies also mean you inherit their business decisions. Pricing changes. Service deprecations. Geographic restrictions. Policy updates. When you build on someone else's infrastructure, you're subject to their roadmap, not yours.

### 3. Platform Dependency

Many AI note takers work by joining your meetings as bots. They need permission from Zoom, Teams, or Google Meet to access the audio. This creates platform dependency.

Platform dependencies are fragile because platforms change the rules. Zoom has updated its bot policies multiple times. Sometimes IT administrators block bots entirely. Enterprise security teams restrict third-party integrations. When this happens, your note taker basically becomes dead weight.

API deprecation is another failure mode. Platforms update their systems, and older integrations break. If your note taker relies on a specific API version, a platform update can render it unusable until the developers patch it. You're not in control of the timeline.

There's also a user experience issue. Bots are visible. They show up in participant lists. They make people ask questions. Some clients won't allow them in meetings. Some conversations are too sensitive. The dependency isn't just technical, it's social.

### 4. Economic Dependency

Usage-based pricing creates economic dependency. When your note taker charges per minute, per meeting, or per transcript, your costs scale with your usage. This works until it doesn't.

We've seen SaaS pricing increase dramatically across the industry. Tools that were affordable at 10 meetings per month become expensive at 50. Features that were included in basic tiers get moved to enterprise plans. Free tiers get restricted.

Economic dependency also shows up in usage caps. You get 100 minutes per month, then you're locked out. Or you get unlimited meetings but limited AI features. The tool works reliably until you cross a threshold. Then you're choosing between paying more or losing functionality.

There's a deeper issue here about sustainability. Cloud processing costs money. If a vendor's unit economics don't work, they have two options: raise prices or shut down. Users inherit this risk. You build workflows around a tool, then the tool becomes unaffordable or disappears.

### 5. Compliance Dependency

For many professionals—doctors, lawyers, therapists, financial advisors—using an AI note taker isn't just about functionality. It's about compliance. HIPAA for healthcare. Attorney-client privilege for legal. SOC 2 for enterprise. GDPR for European operations.

Cloud-based tools create compliance dependencies because your data leaves your device. It gets processed on someone else's servers. It might cross geographic boundaries. It might be stored in multi-tenant databases. Each of these creates compliance questions.

Can you prove where the data was processed? Can you guarantee it wasn't used for training? Can you delete it completely? Can you prevent unauthorized access? With cloud tools, you're trusting the vendor's compliance, not ensuring your own.

## What This Means for You

When you're choosing an AI note taker, don't start with features. Start with architecture.

Ask: What does this tool require to function? Does it need internet? Does it depend on external services? Does it require platform permissions? Does it charge based on usage? Does it send data off my device?

Each requirement is an architectural dependency. Each dependency is a trade-off, but sometimes trade-offs can be worth it and that's exactly what you need to decide.

## How We Are Building Char

This dependency thinking is shaping every architectural decision we're making with Char.

We're starting with a simple premise: the tool should work without requiring anything external. No internet. No cloud services. No platform permissions. No usage limits. No data leaving your device. Then, we're letting users add the capabilities they want—cloud AI, integrations, exports—as optional layers, not requirements.

**Local processing by default.** Char everything on-device. Transcription happens locally using Whisper models. Summarization uses our custom HyperLLM model that we're optimizing for on-device performance. Nothing needs to leave your machine for the tool to function. You can use Char in airplane mode, in restricted networks, in secure facilities, anywhere.

**Deployment flexibility.** Because we're open-source, you're not locked into how or where you run Char. Use it on your device for edge deployment. Self-host on your own servers for complete control. Deploy to your private cloud if you need to scale with isolation. The architecture supports all three: on-device, on-premises, or private cloud, depending on your needs.

**Direct audio capture.** Our platform captures system audio and microphone input directly at the OS level. No bots. No platform permissions. No dependency on whether Zoom or Teams allows access. The tool just records what's coming through your speakers and mic. This works for all meeting platforms and for in-person conversations.

**Forever free, unlimited.** We're not charging per meeting, per minute, or per transcript. Core functionality (unlimited transcription and summarization) is free. Forever. You can connect your own language models, your own speech-to-text providers, and use it as much as you need. No artificial caps. No surprises.

**Compliance by architecture.** Because data stays local by default, compliance becomes simpler. HIPAA requirements? Your patient data never leaves your device. Attorney-client privilege? Conversations stay on your machine. GDPR data residency? You control exactly where data lives. SOC 2 requirements? Self-host and manage your own security controls. The architecture gives you the foundation to meet your compliance needs.
