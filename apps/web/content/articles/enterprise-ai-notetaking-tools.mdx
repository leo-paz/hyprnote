If you're evaluating AI notetaking tools for your organization, you're probably dealing with questions like: "Can our legal team actually use this?" "What happens to our data?" or "Will IT have a meltdown when I suggest this?"

Most AI notetaking tools weren't built for enterprises. They were built for individuals, then scaled up with "enterprise features" bolted on later. This creates predictable friction during procurement: the tool technically works, but it violates data policies, lacks the right deployment options, or creates compliance headaches nobody anticipated.

This guide cuts through the marketing noise and covers five notetaking solutions that work for enterprises.

## AI Notetakers For Enterprises: At a Glance

1. **Char**: Open-source, zero lock-in AI notepad with complete control over data and AI stack
2. **Read AI**: Cloud platform with unified search across meetings, emails, and messages
3. **MeetGeek**: Conversation intelligence with team-level analytics and performance tracking
4. **Fellow**: Internal meeting focus with granular privacy controls for manager workflows
5. **Plaud**: Hardware devices for field professionals needing portable, offline-capable recording

## How We Chose These AI Notetakers

We evaluated dozens of tools and narrowed the list to five based on what procurement teams actually need to see:

- **Security and compliance readiness**: Does the tool have the certifications, architectural design, or deployment options that let it pass your legal and security review?
- **Administrative control**: We prioritized tools with SSO, role-based permissions, audit trails, user provisioning, and data retention policies that work across hundreds or thousands of users.
- **Integration depth**: Does it plug into your existing stack (CRMs, collaboration tools, document repos)? We focused on tools that meet teams where they work.
- **Production-proven**: We prioritized tools already deployed at Fortune 500 companies, healthcare systems, legal firms, and government agencies.

The five tools we're covering represent fundamentally different architectural approaches. If one doesn't fit your requirements, another likely will.

- **All-prem**: Complete organizational control with all components running on your infrastructure
- **Prem-hybrid**: STT and database on-premises while LLM workloads run in controlled environments—balances compliance with powerful AI capabilities

#### Pricing

<Image src="/api/images/blog/enterprise-ai-notetaking-tools/enterprise-2.webp" alt="Char pricing" />

Char is free forever for local transcription, BYOK, and all core features. Managed cloud service is $8/month for the easiest setup.

Enterprise pricing applies when your organization needs an on-premises deployment, SSO integration, consent management, multi-factor authentication, an agentic workflow builder, 24/7 priority support, or custom branding. [Contact sales for a quote](/founders).

#### Enterprise Features

- **End-to-end encryption**: Zero-trust architecture with hardware security module support protects data at every stage—from capture to storage to processing.
- **Multi-framework compliance**: Built-in support for HIPAA, SOC 2, ISO 27001, GDPR, and CCPA without requiring new certifications or security reviews. Works with existing compliance frameworks.
- **Smart consent management**: Built-in recording consent collection with audit logs for all acknowledgments, ensuring compliance with one-party, two-party, or all-party consent laws.
- **Enterprise authentication**: SSO (SAML 2.0/OIDC) and Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) with seamless integration into your existing identity provider.
- **Access management**: Advanced role-based permissions and granular controls for managing who can record, access, and share meeting data across the organization.
- **Audit and monitoring**: Comprehensive audit trails and real-time monitoring track all access and usage, with a custom admin dashboard builder for visibility.
- **Team collaboration**: Securely share notes with team-level controls, ensuring information flows to the right people while maintaining governance.
- **Universal meeting compatibility**: Works with all platforms (Zoom, Teams, Meet, etc.) without requiring bots—captures both microphone and system audio directly.
- **Vendor-agnostic AI**: Connect to OpenAI, Mistral, Ollama (via LM Studio), or any custom endpoint—no vendor lock-in for LLM processing.
- **Workflow integrations**: Current integrations with Obsidian and Attio, with enterprise customers driving additional integration priorities based on their tech stack.
- **Custom model support**: Bring your own speech-to-text and language models, plus calendar integration for automatic meeting detection.

#### How it works

Char uses two types of models: speech-to-text (STT) and large language models (LLMs).

For transcription, Char uses the Whisper series from Hugging Face, which ranges from the lightweight Tiny and Base models to the V3 Large Turbo. Users choose based on their accuracy vs. speed requirements.

For summarization and intelligence, Char developed HyperLLM-V1, a custom model based on Qwen 1.7B architecture. At just 1.1GB (compared to LLaMA's 2.0GB), it delivers high-quality summaries optimized for English while being extremely fast.

All of this happens locally. Char captures both microphone input and system audio output, allowing it to work universally across various meeting platforms without requiring bots. No internet required for core functionality.

Your transcription and note data never touch external servers unless you explicitly choose to connect an LLM provider for additional features. Speaker identification works automatically for one-on-one calls by distinguishing between the microphone and system audio.

For group meetings, users manually tag speakers using the transcript editor. Real-time transcription is supported with latency varying based on model size and hardware capabilities. Export options include Markdown, PDF, and Rich Text.

#### Limitations & Trade-offs

- **Platform availability**: Currently macOS only (Sonoma 14.2+), optimized for Apple Silicon.
- **Speaker identification**: Limited to basic two-channel distinction (mic vs. system audio). Real-time speaker diarization for multi-person meetings isn't available yet.
- **Language support**: Transcription supports all languages, but quality varies (strong for English/Korean, weaker for Hindi/Persian). HyperLLM-V1 summarization is fine-tuned exclusively for English.
